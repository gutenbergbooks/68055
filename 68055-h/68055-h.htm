  <h2 class='c009'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> public-school system of Gary, Indiana,
has attracted during the last few years the
general attention of progressive educators all
over the country as perhaps the most ingenious
attempt yet made to meet the formidable
problems of congested urban life and modern
vocational demands which are presented to
the administrators of the city school. A broad
educational philosophy has combined with
administrative skill to produce a type of
school which represents a fundamental reorganization
of the public school to meet changing
social and industrial conditions. A new
balance of school activities, an increased
wealth of facilities, the opening-up of opportunities
to the younger children, the institution
of a new kind of vocational training, the
fusing of activities into an organic whole so
that the school becomes a children’s community,
the correlation of school activities with
community activities, and lastly, the application
of principles of economics to public-school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>management which permit greatly
increased educational and recreational facilities
not only for children in the schools,
but also for adults,—these are the features
of the Gary school system that have aroused
the enthusiasm of many educators, and made
it one of the most visited and discussed school
systems in the country. Dr. David Snedden,
Commissioner of Education in Massachusetts,
has said that the system of education at
Gary “more adequately meets the needs of
city children than any other system of which
the writer has knowledge.” Professor John
Dewey declared recently, at a public meeting
in New York City, called to discuss the adoption
of the Gary plan in the New York
schools, that “no more important question
affecting the future of the people of New York
has come before them for many years.” The
United States Bureau of Education in 1914
published a report on the Gary schools, made
after “a careful and prolonged study at first
hand” extending over a period of two years.
In this report Commissioner P. P. Claxton
records his belief that “the superintendent
and board of education of the Gary schools
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>have succeeded in working out plans for a
more economic use of school funds, a fuller
and more effective use of the time of the children,
a better adjustment of the work of the
schools to the condition and needs of individual
children, greater economy in supervision,
a better correlation of the so-called ‘regular
work’ and ‘special activities’ of the school, a
more practical form of industrial education,
and at a cost less nearly prohibitive than is
usually found in public schools in the cities of
this country.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Schools in many towns and cities in all
parts of the country have been reorganized
on the Gary plan or have been experimenting
with it. The Gary plan has been introduced
in the schools of small cities such as Sewickley,
Newcastle, and Swarthmore, Pennsylvania;
Kalamazoo, Michigan; Winetka, Illinois.
Kansas City has been experimenting with it.
The Chicago authorities have recently pronounced
their two years’ experiment an unqualified
success. Passaic, New Jersey, has
a highly successful Gary school in operation.
In Troy, New York, the authorities
are reorganizing the entire school system
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>on the Gary plan. In New York City two
schools were operated for most of the
school year, 1914-15, Superintendent Wirt
of Gary having been called in to supervise
the reorganization and advise the Board of
Education in their attempt to meet the “part-time”
problems in congested school districts.
As a result of this experiment the Board of
Education has recently decided to extend the
Gary plan to two school districts in the Borough
of the Bronx, involving fourteen schools
and 46,000 pupils. Superintendent Wirt has
presented figures to show that, by the adoption
of the Gary plan and the expenditure of
only $5,000,000 (the cost of a dozen school
buildings which would provide at the maximum
for 20,000 children), the New York
authorities could practically relieve their
part-time situation which now involves 132,000
children. Not only has the success of the
Gary plan been striking in the larger cities,
but it has proved its adaptability to the small
school as well. Three of the schools of Gary
are practically rural schools in outlying districts,
but the principles of the Gary plan are
found applicable there as well as in the recently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>erected model school plants. The flexibility
of the plan, the ingenuity and soundness
of its economical and educational principles,
its feasibility of imitation, and adaptation to
communities the most diverse, makes its discussion
one of national significance.</p>

<p class='c007'>The material on the Gary plan has been
generally confined to bulletins, magazine
articles, and educational reports. One of the
best discussions of the Gary school is to be
found in a chapter of Professor Dewey’s recent
book, which contains, in addition, the
educational theory and historical background
upon which the Gary plan has been worked
out by Superintendent William Wirt, himself
a pupil and disciple of Dewey. I give here a
list of the Gary material which I have used.
Some of it is generally available, some not. I
am much indebted to these investigators. I
have even plagiarized from myself.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>During</span> the past fifteen years I have tried
approximately fifty different programs for
“work-study-and-play schools.” The several
factors in such a school program can be combined
in countless ways. I have not tried to
design a system or type of school program as
a set form that would constitute a universal
ideal school for all children. Rather, I have
tried to develop a system of school administration
that would make possible the providing
of a great variety of school types, so that
all cities and all of the children in the several
parts of a city may have the kind of school
they need.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have had only two fixed principles since
I began establishing work-study-and-play
schools at Bluffton, Indiana, in the year
1900.</p>

<p class='c007'>First: All children should be busy all day
long at work, study, and play under right
conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>Second: Cities can finance an adequate
work-study-and-play program only when all
the facilities of the entire community for the
work, study, and play of children are properly
coördinated with the school, the coördinating
agent, so that all facilities supplement one
another and “peak-loads” are avoided by
keeping all facilities of the school plant in use
all of the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>At what children work, study, and play;
how they work, study, and play; when and
where they work, study, and play; what facilities
are provided for work, study, and play;
and the total and relative amount of time
given to work, study, and play;—these may
vary with every city and with every school in
a city. No set system can possibly meet the
needs of all children, nor could a set system be
uniformly provided with the existing child-welfare
facilities.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not desirable or possible uniformly to
establish one particular scheme of departmentalizing
work between teachers or of rotating
classes between different types of facilities.
The only important thing is so to departmentalize
teaching and so to rotate classes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>that the teachers may render the greatest
service with the least expenditure of energy,
and that the maximum use may be secured
from the school plant and other child-welfare
facilities.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>I<br /> <br /><span class='c020'>THE COMMUNITY SETTING</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>To</span> set the Gary schools in their proper
perspective, one must discount at the start
any prevailing impression that the distinctive
traits are due to peculiar local conditions, or
to the enlightened philanthropy of the United
States Steel Corporation, which founded the
town in 1906 as the site for its new plant, the
most complete system of steel mills west of
Pittsburg. For to the steel officials the building
of the town was incidental to the creation
of the plant. Gary in consequence is far less
of a “satellite city” than other made-to-order
towns. The opportunity to plan the city,
provide fundamental necessities for community
life, determine the character of the housing,
and predestine the lines of growth, all in
the best and most enlightened way, was taken
advantage of by the Steel Corporation only in
part. Very little of the marvelous science and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>engineering skill that went into the making of
the steel plant went into the even more important
task of creating a model city. Several
hundred houses were built, it is true, for the
skilled labor and officialdom of the plants, but
practically no attempt was made to house the
low-paid unskilled labor. The result has been
the development of large tracts by land speculators,
and all the problems of congestion and
bad housing and sanitation that curse the
larger industrial cities. The connection of the
Steel Corporation with the town has been
throughout that of any land and development
company. Communal problems have all been
thrown upon the people themselves to solve.
The new community was incorporated as soon
as possible as a municipality under the laws
of the State of Indiana, and has organized all
its municipal functions, including the public
schools, in entire independence of the Steel
Corporation, with which it has had no more
political or institutional connection than any
ordinary American town has with its local
industrial interests. The Corporation has by
no means paid more than its share of the local
taxes, and the schools, in particular, have not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>only been quite free from the Corporation
influence or support, but have even at times
run so far counter to the approval of the Corporation
officials that the school administration
has had difficulty in acquiring its needed
sites for new schools. It can be emphatically
said that the schools of Gary are no more the
product of peculiar conditions than are the
schools of numberless rapidly growing Western
towns.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mushroom growth of Gary has not
meant a peculiar kind of a town, but simply
the telescoping into a few years of the typical
municipal evils of graft, franchise fights,
saloon dominance, insufficient housing and
health regulation, election frauds, and lack of
social cohesion. Its dramatic growth has not
prevented its becoming a very typical American
city. In April, 1906, Gary was a waste of
sand-dunes and scrub-oak swamps at the
southern end of Lake Michigan. Three years
later it had a steel plant covering an area of a
square mile and capable of employing 140,000
men; it had a population of 12,000; 15 miles
of paved streets, 25 miles of cement sidewalks,
$2,000,000 worth of residences, sewer, water,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>gas, and electric facilities; it had 2 banks, 6
hotels, 3 dailies, 2 schools, 10 church denominations,
46 lawyers, 24 physicians—in
short, all the paraphernalia of the modern
city. The visitor who goes to-day to Gary
finds a typically varied American city, rather
better built than the average, and rather unusually
favored in its open spaces. Situated
within thirty miles of Chicago, the city presents
a rather pleasing contrast to the long
chain of industrial towns that stretches for
miles in every direction across the treeless
prairie. With a well-built business section,
lines of residence streets, handsome public
buildings and churches, electric cars and taxi-cabs,
Gary has a settled air of community life
unusual even for an older town. It has almost
the aspect of a commercial rather than an
industrial center. It is the focus of the county
trade, and the extent of its business and middle-class
residential districts is somewhat
larger than in neighboring towns. The steel
mills and subsidiary plants are massed along
the lake and the artificially constructed harbor.
The great immigrant population, largely
of cheap and illiterate proletarian labor from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>southeastern Europe, inhabits the congested
district of the South Side. The mills are separated
from the town by a small river which
forms almost a moat for the great industrial
fortress. The town is laid out in checkerboard
fashion, with a wide main avenue a hundred
feet wide and cross-streets sixty feet wide.
Alleys run the long way of the blocks, and
contain the sewer and water mains. Ethnologically
the population is very mixed. Thirty
nationalities are said to be represented in the
schools, but this large foreign population is a
familiar phenomenon in the American industrial
town. A rough census taken in 1908
gave the foreign population of Gary as fifty-six
per cent of the whole. In 1912 it was only
forty per cent, or a decrease of sixteen per
cent. The alien influx has not destroyed the
essentially characteristic American features
of the city. The native American element has
always predominated politically and socially.
For an American city of its size to-day, Gary
represents, not a specialized community, but
a fairly harmonious distribution of social
classes, races, occupations, and interests. It
is essentially a normal, variedly functioning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>independent community, and the schools
have been developed to meet the needs of a
modern varied urban community.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be emphasized that neither the
demands of a peculiar type of industrial community
nor the work of benevolent philanthropy
created the schools of Gary. They
have been developed in response to the typically
current needs of a normal American
municipality. They have had to meet the
same situations which all American cities are
confronting in their effort to educate “all the
children of all the people.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Organized under a school administration
consisting of a board of education with three
members working in conjunction with a superintendent
of schools, the school system
depends for support entirely upon local taxation
and the usual sources of revenue, and
enjoys no unusual municipal or financial advantages.
On the contrary, the enterprise of
providing public schools for the town of Gary
was one of peculiar difficulty. The new and
rapidly growing town required the immediate
creation of a school plant, in addition to the
annual cost of instruction and maintenance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>The community was poor. A large proportion
of the people, being recently arrived immigrants,
owned no taxable property. The
plants of the Steel Corporation, the most valuable
property in the community, were habitually
undervalued in the assessments. The
state laws, moreover, provide that school revenues
for any given year are to be obtained
on an assessment made almost two years before.
The result in a new city like Gary,
where the population had been doubling each
year, was, therefore, that current school revenues
had to be based on assessment values
obtained when the population was only one
quarter as great.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the face of all these formidable difficulties
the success of the Gary school system
seems little short of amazing. In the short
space of eight years the population has increased
from three hundred to over thirty
thousand. No ordinary city would attempt
to supply school facilities to a population
which doubled every year. The mere physical
problem of providing seats for the children
would be insurmountable. A city which followed
the conventional school plan would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>swamped. At the present time, with their
much slower yearly increase of population,
half of the cities of over one hundred thousand
in this country have insufficient sittings for
their children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet with its leaping movement of population
the city of Gary has been able to provide
not only full-time instruction for every child,
but actually a longer school day. It has not
only done this, but it has provided evening school
instruction for an even greater number
of adults. There is something pardonable in
the Gary boast that every third person in the
city goes to school. And Gary has succeeded
not only in giving this universal schooling,
but in making it what is probably the most
varied and stimulating elementary public-school
instruction in the United States, with
an equipment in buildings and facilities for
work, study, and play which is surpassed, if
anywhere, only in specially favored communities.
All this has been done with a normal
tax-rate, and at a <i>per-capita</i> cost of both
construction and maintenance no greater than
that in the city of Chicago and the city of
New York, with their many overcrowded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>and poorly equipped school-buildings. The
Gary schools, at the same time, have paid
the highest teachers’ salaries in the State.
The entire achievement has been as brilliant
as the difficulties confronted were formidable.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is these remarkable results that have
focused the attention of so many educators on
Gary, and it will be the purpose of this book
to expound the “unique and ingenious synthesis
of educational influences” which has
made them possible. If, then, in the course of
eight years, the schools of Gary have acquired
a wide reputation as a momentous educational
experiment which has passed into successful
demonstration, the fact must be laid entirely
to the abilities of the school authorities, and
not to any adventitious factors of the community
situation or of private assistance.
The dominating factor was the personal genius
of the superintendent, William Wirt, who
was called to Gary in 1908 from Bluffton,
Indiana, where he had been in charge of the
public schools, and where he had partly
worked out some of the ideas which he was
later to develop so comprehensively in the
Gary schools. When it is objected that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Gary plan is an experiment, and that eight
years are scarcely sufficient time to pronounce
upon its merits, it must be remembered that
the real experimental stage of the Gary plan
consisted in the eight years in Bluffton. Mr.
Wirt came to Gary with his educational
ideas matured after this long testing. He
was brought to Gary by the unusually progressive
mayor and school board of the new
town, for the express purpose of working out
on a large scale the principles which they
had seen in concrete application at Bluffton.
Against the financial meagerness of the
town’s resources and the obstructiveness of
the founders must, therefore, be set the advantage
of having a virgin field in which to
work. The superintendent and school board
were able in a remarkably short time to build
up a public interest and support which has
been a very large asset. The people of Gary
seem proud of their schools, and seem to appreciate
the comprehensive educational and
recreational facilities which through them
are provided for both children and adults.
Few educational experiments have been so
successful in technique and in popular support.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>The Gary schools represent the fruit of
a very unusual combination of educational
philosophy, economic engineering, and political
sagacity. Circumstances seem to have
conspired to produce a school system which
unites a very remarkable school plant with a
synthesis of novel plans of operation which
are fertile in suggestion to school men, if
they do not tend to revolutionize many
methods of financing public schools as well
as methods of administration and teaching.</p>

<p class='c007'>This outline of the setting of the Gary
schools scarcely puts the background in its
correct light. When we speak of the “Gary
school” we are really talking about something
bigger than the educational system of a small
Western city. What we have to deal with is
an educational idea, a comprehensive plan
for the modern public school, capable of general
imitation and adaptation to the needs of
other American communities. In this sense
it means primarily what Superintendent Wirt
thought a public school should be. Being at
once a social engineer and educational philosopher,
he has succeeded in working out a type-plan
of public school which to many educators
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>appears uniquely valuable in American public
education. The discussion which follows attempts
to describe the Gary schools from this
larger point of view. The effort is to show in
detail how the plan actually works in the
schools of Gary, while at the same time to suggest
the larger ideas and principles which have
motivated it. The “Gary plan” represents, of
course, not only what has been done in Gary,
but its further implications and tendencies, as
well as the developments and modifications
now working out in those schools, such as the
group in New York City, which have been put
in the hands of the Gary authorities for reorganization.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>II<br /> <br /><span class='c020'>THE SCHOOL PLANT: EDUCATING THE WHOLE CHILD</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>This</span> children’s community, as worked out
by Mr. Wirt in the Gary schools, is a work-study-and-play
school of the most varied
kind. It represents, in fact, an ideal school
plant which was well outlined in Mr. Wirt’s
mind when he first came to Gary. Schools like
the magnificent Emerson and Froebel plants
in Gary, and the new Pestalozzi School, for
which plans have already been drawn and the
site bought, represent the working-out in
concrete form of this ideal. At the same time,
it must be understood that the essential features
of the Wirt plan are possible in schools
which were not built from the ideal plan.
Perhaps Mr. Wirt’s greatest triumph in Gary
is not these new schools, but the old Jefferson
School, which he found when he came to the
town, and which, by ingenious remodeling, he
turned from a conventional school-building
into a completely functioning school. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Wirt plan is momentous as showing what a
really modern public school should embody, it
is no less momentous in showing how easily
the old type of schoolhouse may be adapted
to the varied life of the school community
that is the Wirt school.</p>

<p>THE EMERSON SCHOOL</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It will first be necessary to describe the
ideal school plant as represented in the Emerson
and Froebel Schools in Gary. This plant
carries out a belief in educating the whole
child, physically, artistically, manually, scientifically,
as well as intellectually. Mr. Wirt
believes that by putting in the child’s way all
the opportunities for varied development, the
child will be able to select those activities for
which he is best suited, and thus develop his
capacities to their highest power. This can be
done only in a school which provides, besides
the ordinary classrooms, also playgrounds and
gardens, gymnasiums and swimming-pools,
special drawing and music studios, science
laboratories, MACHINE-SHOPs, and intimate
and constant contact with supplementary
community activities outside the school. The
Wirt school is based on a fourfold unity of
interests,—play and exercise, intellectual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>study, special work in shop and laboratory,
etc., and social and expressive activity in auditorium
or outside community agency.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between these activities there is no invidious
distinction. The manual and artistic are
not subordinated to the intellectual, as in the
ordinary school. The “special activities” are
not mere trimmings to the “regular work,”
but neither is the latter neglected in favor of
the former. The ideal of the Wirt plan is that
the child should have every day, in some form
or other, contact with all the different activities
which influence a well-rounded human
being, instead of meeting them perfunctorily
once or twice a week, as in the ordinary school.
This does not mean, of course, that every
child is expected to develop into a versatile
genius, equally able in science and music and
shopwork and history. Most children are
sternly limited in their capacities, and will be
unable to assimilate more than a small part of
what the school offers them. But the Wirt
school definitely offers the opportunity. If
there are capacities, they have the chance to
develop, while no child need lack that speaking
acquaintance with the varied interests of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>work and study which now the old traditional
type of school so tragically denies.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is an essential feature of the Wirt scheme
that this varied work be provided for all the
children from the earliest possible years. The
lavish equipment of the ideal Wirt school
plant may be paralleled in other communities
than Gary, but it is paralleled only in the case
of the secondary schools. It is a notorious fact
that, of the children who begin the American
public school, only one fifth ever reach even
the first year of the high school. So far it is the
high school or the highest grammar grades
that have received practically all of the advantages
of broadening educational endeavor,—vocational
training, science laboratory
work, the study of civics, domestic science,
etc. This means that the vast majority of
school-children leave school with nothing
but the barest intellectual training, without
ever having come in contact with points of
view and ways of doing things that are absolutely
essential to any understanding or
effectiveness in the world above the very lowest.
Against this fundamentally undemocratic
system, which denies help to those who need
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>it most, the Wirt plan resolutely sets its
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ideal Wirt school contains in one school
plant the complete school, with all the classes
from the kindergarten through the common
school and high school.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this plan both economic and educational
advantages are realized. From an economic
point of view, it is cheaper to have large, completely
equipped centers than to duplicate the
equipment in a number of smaller centers.
From an educational point of view, it enables
pupils to bridge the chasm between the elementary
grades and the high school. By
ceasing to make the high school a separate
institution to be “entered” or “graduated
from,” pupils find no place to stop when they
have completed the eight grades.</p>

<p class='c007'>The complete school, Mr. Wirt believes,
offers important moral gains. “The development
of character, habits of industry, reliability,
good health, and the growth of intelligence
require time,” he says, “and must be a
continuous process throughout the entire life
of the child.” The complete school gives an
opportunity for that coöperation or “apprenticeship”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>between the younger and older
children, which is so important a feature of
the Wirt school, and this association breaks
down the snobbery of age which causes so
much unhappiness in childhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be admitted that in Gary, owing to
the progressive mortality in attendance which
is common everywhere, it is possible to realize
the complete school only in the Emerson and
Froebel plants. At the same time it must be
remembered that these schools care for three
quarters of the school-children of the town.
In the elementary schools which Mr. Wirt is
reorganizing in New York, he is asking that
there shall be included at least two of the high-school
years, in order that the complete school
may be approximated as closely as possible.
In Gary, they are working for a school which
is even more than “complete,” for they aim to
include even the first year and perhaps even
the second of the ordinary college course.
Stretching down boldly past the kindergarten
to a nursery for babies, and up into the college
itself, the Wirt school thus gives a fundamentally
new orientation to education, shows it
graphically and practically as a continuous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>process, and breaks down those artificial barriers
by which we measure off “education,”
and make it easy for people to “finish” it.
The Wirt school seems definitely to forecast
the day when the public school will have
swallowed the college, and the “higher education”
will have become as local and available
as the three R’s.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c007'>If the school is to educate the whole child,
the first need is evidently a place for him to
grow. “The best of education,” says Professor
Terman, “is but wisely directed growth.”
“The activities of a child,” says Professor
Dewey, “are the means by which he becomes
acquainted with his world, and by which he
learns the use and limits of his own powers.”
The lack of free activity in the conventional
school has been the major cause of those
symptoms of morbidity which school hygienists
have brought to the attention of educators
within the last few years. Over-pressure and
confinement have made the school a manufactory
for evils which the next generation will
look back to with amazement at the blindness
of the educational world which permitted it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The ideal school will make the playground
the very center of its life. The school in the
Wirt plan covers a site of from ten to twenty
acres. Actually the Emerson School in Gary
has ten acres; Froebel has twelve; the new
Tolleston site covers twenty acres. Of this
ideal site of twenty acres, ten acres in front of
the school-building are purchased by the city
and maintained by it as an open public square
or small park. The remaining ten acres are
bought by the school for the building site and
playgrounds. It is the intention in Gary to
have these park-school playgrounds distributed
over the city so that few families will
live more than half a mile away from one of
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a cardinal principle of the Wirt plan
that the parks and playgrounds of a city
should be placed as <i>adjuncts of the schools</i>. It
is the schools that they primarily serve and
it is with the schools that they should be
grouped. Millions of dollars have been wasted
in the public-playground movement in this
country through disregard of this fact. There
is a good story of a Chicago playground instructor
who, when asked if the playgrounds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>coöperated with the schools, replied, “Sure
we do! If we see any kid on here between
nine and three, we chase him off!” This is
symbolic of the lack of intelligent coöperation
between child-welfare agencies. It is this
wasteful and ineffective situation which the
Wirt plan remedies by boldly annexing park
and playground to the school itself. A comparison
of the Chicago playgrounds with the
Gary school playgrounds shows the immensely
greater public service rendered under
the Wirt scheme. Chicago has one of the
most elaborate systems of recreation parks
and field-houses in the country. Yet in a district
only <i>one fortieth</i> the size of the Chicago
district, one Gary school, providing for both
children and adults, gave indoor gymnasium
work to three times as many people;
shower-baths to one third as many; outdoor
gymnasium to an equal number; the use of
swimming-pools to half as many; use of the
assembly halls to four times as many; and to
as many, the use of clubrooms and reading-rooms.
Thus, in educating the child’s body,
and giving him space to grow and play, the
Wirt school enormously increased the opportunities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>of every one in the district, old and
young, to secure the same advantages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ideal Wirt school plant, such as the
Emerson School in Gary, in its open space of
ten acres, besides its playground filled with apparatus,
has gardens, tennis courts, ball fields,
running tracks, and handball courts. For the
younger children there are wading-pools and
sandpits. One field is arranged so that it may
be flooded in winter for skating. There are
two acres of school-gardens, and a cluster of
cages and houses for the animals of the school
zoo. The outdoor equipment is, in other
words, on the scale of a college or a wealthy
private school which can afford spacious
grounds and provision for every athletic
sport. The Gary schools are, however, public
schools, and these facilities are open to all the
children of all ages and all the time.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE SWIMMING-POOL AT THE FROEBEL SCHOOL</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is customary for our newer high schools
to have gymnasiums, but the common school
is rarely provided for. In the Wirt school, the
common school shares, of course, in the extensive
gymnasium equipment. The Emerson
School has two gymnasiums, one for boys and
one for girls. It has also a large swimming-pool.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>The Froebel School has two gymnasiums
and two swimming-pools. The Jefferson
School has a large gymnasium, though only
the common school is provided for in the Jefferson.
The other Gary schools all have gymnasiums
proportionate to their size. In the
new school plants it is intended to build pergolas
about the inner court which will contain
open-air classrooms and additional outdoor
gymnasium space. Nothing is omitted which
will provide the right physical conditions for
the child’s growth and development from his
earliest years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coming to the school-building itself, we find
in the Emerson and Froebel Schools architectural
creations of unusual beauty and impressiveness.
The school-building is built
around a great court, with broad halls as wide
as streets, and well lighted from the court.
These broad halls serve not only as the school
streets for the constant passage of the children
between their work, but also as centers for the
“application” work, or for informal study.
They are so wide that all confusion is avoided,
and they suggest to the visitor that they serve
the school community in the same way that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the agora or forum did the ancient city. In
the Emerson School the beginning of an art
gallery has been made. It suggests the idea
that just as the schools ought to absorb the
playgrounds, so they ought to absorb the
museums and galleries. Pictures and objects
of art and interest become unreal and artificial
when immured in isolated museums,
which can be visited only at special times and
with effort. They should be at hand in the
school, fertilizing and beautifying every moment
of its daily life. The artistic sense can
be cultivated only by bringing children into
contact daily and almost unconsciously with
beautiful things. The schools themselves must
be art galleries, and these fine corridors of the
Wirt school indicate the way by which a
wholly new orientation is to be given to our
public galleries by using them as adjuncts to
the education of children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Similarly with museums. The teaching of
the Gary schools, based fundamentally on
concrete things and processes, needs to be
constantly in touch with the objects which it
is our custom to store in dead museums. The
school museum is an essential feature of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Wirt school. The Wirt plan does not contemplate
the taking of children docilely about
to visit museums, as some progressive teachers
are doing. It contemplates bringing the
museums into the schools, so that the children
can know the treasures and live with them
and learn about them.</p>

<p class='c007'>And similarly with libraries. Mr. Wirt believes
that the school may do the work of the
public library much more efficiently and
much more economically than the library can
itself do it. He has shown in Gary that in a
school branch of the public library, library
maintenance and circulation cost per book
circulation is only about five per cent of the
cost in the main library, while the life of the
book circulated in sets under the control of
the teachers is ten times that of the usual
circulation book in the library. In both the
Emerson and Froebel Schools there is a
branch of the public library, under a library
assistant. Children use the library as a part of
their regular work under the supervision of
the assistant and teachers. All sorts of stereoscopic
pictures, photographs, collections of
pictures, atlases, etc., can thus be provided,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>which would be impossible for the classroom.
The library becomes the storehouse of the
knowledge of the school, and the children
learn to recognize it as such. Again, the library
is already an important feature of
many of the newer high schools throughout
the country. In the Wirt school, however, all
the elementary classes use it also.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Wirt school contemplates bringing all
the cultural resources of the community to
bear on the school. It makes the school the
proper and natural depository for whatever
the community has to offer in artistic interest
or intellectual resource. Like most of the
features of the Wirt plan, this consolidation
of gallery, museum, and library in the school
is as economically efficient as it is educationally
valuable.</p>

<p class='c007'>A word must be said about the auditorium.
Few schools have assembly rooms like that
in the Froebel School in Gary, with its stage
large enough for a full-sized basketball game
or athletic contest. The unique rôle of the
auditorium in the Wirt school will be described
in the next chapter. It assists materially
in educating the whole child by giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>him opportunities for public expression before
the school community.</p>

<p class='c007'>The classrooms in the ideal Wirt school are
much more attractive than the ordinary classrooms,
far less formal and far less crowded.
In some of them the old-fashioned school desk
and seat have been retained, largely, according
to Mr. Wirt, to meet the prejudice of the
parents. Owing to the frequent change and
movement of classes, however, this peculiarly
flagrant instrument of educational perversity
does little harm. Many of the lower grades
have a desk, made in the school, which is a
kind of workbench. These desks have vises
attached, and loose tops, which can be readily
replaced when soiled or worn out. The
seat is a four-legged stool, which can be
pushed out of the way when the child is using
his desk for a workbench. On occasion the
children can take up their stools and desktops
and go off to work in the halls or garden.
Such a room is an ideal classroom, with its
hint of the workshop and its lack of rigidity.
In the history room in the Emerson School
are broad tables that can be used for map-drawing.
The idea is to give to each classroom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the physical setting and the furniture
which will best enable a particular kind of
work to be done there. The result is that the
classrooms of the Wirt schools have a character
of their own, quite different from the colorless
and depressing effect of the ordinary
classroom. They are not merely rooms where
children study together and tamely recite, but
essentially workshops where children do interesting
things with their minds, just as in the
shops they do interesting things with their
hands. The history room is a real history
laboratory. Maps and charts made by the
pupils cover the walls, magazines lie about,
pictures and books overflow the tables. The
visitor realizes that he is in a room saturated
with history, past and present. It is easier to
learn in a room where everything appeals to
the imagination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wirt says that you never can tell when
a child is learning. The time that he makes
progress is not necessarily the recitation time.
It is the constant impingement of impressions
that really educates him, and it is this that
the intellectual side of the Wirt school is skillfully
designed to cultivate. Music and expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>and drawing are taught, not in regular
classrooms, but in special studios, which are
genuine studios equipped with all the facilities
to impress upon the child with what seriousness
these things are taken in the Wirt school.
Art tends to mean much more to a child
brought up in such a school, because he works
at it in an impressive environment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The science laboratories for botany, zoölogy,
chemistry, physics, are not only well-equipped
laboratories, but workshops as well.
The botany room in the Gary school has a
large conservatory of vines and plants at the
end; the zoölogy room has a menagerie of
small pets, fowls and birds, guinea-pigs and
rabbits. The physics rooms are in contact
with a machine room where automobiles and
other machines illustrate the practical application
of scientific principles. Everywhere the
attempt is made to give a dramatic and practical
physical setting to the work and study,
so that the child may be learning all the time
by suggestion and imitation. And everywhere
the attempt is made to show that no one activity
is any more important than any other.
Each activity represents one side of that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>whole child to educate whom this school
plant has been built.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manual and industrial work is, of
course, an essential feature of the Wirt school.
The shops are much more extensive than is
customary in even the most progressive public
school, or even in the special trade school.
The Emerson School in Gary has, for instance,
a carpentry-shop, cabinet-shop, paint-shop,
foundry, forge, machine-shop, printery,
sheet-metal shop, electrical shop, sewing-room,
and cooking- and dining-rooms, all
admirably equipped as regular shops, and not
merely as manual-training rooms. The Froebel
School has, besides these shops, a plumbing-shop,
a laundry, a shoemaking-shop and a
pottery-shop. In the smaller schools several
shops are combined into one, as at the Jefferson,
though the work done is just as genuine
as at the ideal plant. The number of shops,
or the variety of work, is, as we shall see in the
next chapter, limited only by the services
which the school demands in the way of
repairing or enhancing its physical facilities.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we have mentioned the room for
commercial studies, the supply-store, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>kindergartens and nurseries, the draughting-rooms,
indoor playrooms, teachers’ room,
conservatory, doctor’s room and dental clinic,
offices, etc., our survey of the school plant is
complete. The arrangement of rooms itself,
however, is very significant. As we pass
around the second floor of the Froebel
School, for instance, we meet, in this order,
pottery-shop, laundry, freehand drawing-room,
two classrooms, physics laboratory,
music and expression studios, conservatory,
two classrooms, botany laboratory, and four
more classrooms. The shops are not segregated
in the basement, but the children in
their various activities work side by side.
Classrooms are placed next to laboratories,
and shops next to studios, in order to impress
the pupil with the unity of the program, and
in order that the younger pupils may have
constantly before their eyes an inviting future
and opportunity. All the rooms, moreover,
have glass doors, and the shops have windows,
so that the children, passing through the halls,
may look in and see others at work at unfamiliar
tasks. In this way their curiosity is likely
to be aroused and the ambition to work at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>these interesting activities in which they see
the older children engaged.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this juxtaposition of the various activities,
therefore, the child has impressed upon
him that school life is a unity in breadth, just
as the combining of the elementary and secondary
school impresses him with the fact
that his school life is a unity in length. No
opportunity is lost to touch his imagination
and excite his curiosity. The school plant itself,
in its mere arrangement and construction,
it will thus be seen, serves a very important
educational purpose. The careful detail
with which this has been worked out in these
ideal school plants of Gary makes the Wirt
school in its physical aspect something very
much more significant than a mere collection
of facilities. Those facilities fit into one another
according to a very comprehensive plan.
They form organs of a genuine school life,
which educates the whole child.</p>

<p class='c007'>This fourfold division of study and recitation
facilities, studio, workshop, and laboratory
facilities, auditorium facilities, and application
and play facilities, is essential to the
working of the Wirt plan. Where the ideal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>school plant is impossible, this fourfold plan
may yet be possible. As has been said, the
greatest triumph of the Wirt plan in Gary is,
perhaps, the Jefferson School, a building of
conventional style, which had been erected
before Mr. Wirt came to Gary. It was an
ordinary school-building with ten classrooms
and auditorium, but no other facilities. By
turning the spacious attic into a gymnasium,
by transforming five of the classrooms into
music and art studios and nature-study
laboratories, by building a general jack-of-all-trades
workshop around the engine- and
boiler-room in the cellar, by building a domestic-science
kitchen in an unused corner, putting
lockers into wasted space, and by equipping
the playground with apparatus, Mr.
Wirt succeeded in transforming an ordinary
school-building, whose prototype may be
found in almost any town in the land, into a
full-fledged, varied, and smoothly running
Wirt school. The reorganization of schools
in New York City and other places has been
done by Mr. Wirt along similar lines.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c022'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Where, in most cases, a mere rearrangement

laboratories will transform a school, in others
special annexes are necessary. These can be
built usually, however, at comparatively
small cost. The use of portable houses by the
smaller schools of Gary has enabled the small
wayside “district school,” hitherto confined
entirely to study and recitation, to transform
itself into a genuine Wirt school, with its fourfold
work and study. Shop, auditorium, and
laboratory and studio can be provided in the
form of small portable houses, and the capacity
of the school as well as its facilities can
thus be greatly increased.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>III<br /> <br /><span class='c020'>WORK, STUDY, AND PLAY: THE SCHOOL AS A COMMUNITY</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> Gary school represents not merely the
old public school with certain added modern
features, but a definite reorganization. Its
aim is to form, with its well-balanced facilities
of work, study, and play, a genuine children’s
community, where the children’s normal
healthy interests are centered, and where they
learn, in Professor Dewey’s phrase, “by doing
the things that have meaning to them as children.”
The Gary school aims to meet the
comparative failure of the public school to-day
to care for the city child. It tries to take
the place of the old household and rural community
life which provided for our forefathers
the practical education of which the
city child in his daily life is deprived to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The full significance of the Gary plan can
scarcely be understood unless it is seen against
this background. “It is impossible,” says
Professor Dewey, “to exaggerate the amount
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>of mental and moral training secured by our
forefathers in the course of the ordinary pursuits
of life. They were engaged in subduing
a new country. Industry was at a premium,
and instead of being of a routine nature pioneer
conditions required initiative, ingenuity,
and pluck.... Production had not yet been
concentrated in factories in congested centers,
but was distributed through villages....
The occupations of daily life engaged the
imagination and enforced knowledge of natural
materials and processes.... Children had
the discipline that came from sharing in useful
activities.... Under such conditions the
schools could hardly have done better than
devote themselves to books.... But conditions
changed, and school materials and methods
did not change to keep pace. Population
shifted to urban centers. Production became
a mass affair carried on in big factories, instead
of a household affair.... Industry was
no longer a local or neighborhood concern.
Manufacturing was split up into a very great
variety of separate processes through the
economies incident upon extreme division of
labor.... The machine worker, unlike the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>older hand worker, is following blindly the
intelligence of others instead of his own knowledge
of materials, tools and processes....
Children have lost the moral and practical discipline
that once came from sharing in the
round of home duties. For a large number
there is little alternative, especially in large
cities, between irksome child labor and demoralizing
child idleness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gary school is an organized attempt to
restore this natural education, adapt it to
modern demands, and thus avoid these alternatives
so disastrous for the future of the
child and the quality of the coming generation.
By making the public school as much as
possible a self-sustaining child community,
Superintendent Wirt believes that all the
benefits of this older education can be attained.
“We cannot,” he says, “trust the
other social institutions to remedy the defects.
Not more than one quarter of the urban children
attend Sunday-School regularly. This
makes an average of only two minutes a day
for all the days and all the children. In fact,
church, Sunday-School, public library, public
playgrounds, Y.M.C.A., Boy Scouts, and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>other child-welfare agencies do not occupy
the time of all the children of a city for more
than an average of ten minutes a day. The
practical effect of this is that the streets and
alleys and the cheap theaters and other commercialized
places of amusement have the
children for over five hours a day. The cities
are not fit places for the rearing of children,
because, as a rule, the streets and alleys have
twice the time for educating the children in
the wrong direction that the school, church,
library, and playground have for educating
them in the right direction.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the justification for extending the
Gary school day to eight hours and limiting
vacations. This is the plan which gives ample
time for the intensive use of the remarkable
school plant described in the preceding chapter.
For in place of using for the special work
and play activities a part of the already too
few regular school hours per year, the Gary
school secures additional time for these activities
by appropriating the now worse than
wasted “street-and-alley time” of the masses
of city children. Saturday school, vacation
school, even an all-year school, are features of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>the Gary plan which carry out this principle
of providing a school life for the children for
as long a time as they can be induced and
encouraged to continue it. The Gary school
deliberately seeks to employ and satisfy the
children’s time with wholesome and interesting
activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>It aims not only to organize the daily life of
the child for the greater part of his time, but
it seeks to provide for him in a self-sustaining
community. This means that all the work and
study converge upon the school life. The
things that are done in the Gary school contribute
to the usefulness, the beauty, or the
interest of the school community. The Gary
school is built on the sound psychological
theory that only such work as has meaning in
the life of the school, as lived by the children
themselves then and there, will be really
learned and assimilated. The school is not
only to be a “preparation for life”: it is to be
a life itself, as the old household was a life
itself. “The idea that children should study
exclusively for eight years, and then work exclusively
for the rest of their life,” says Superintendent
Wirt, “is really a new idea in civilization.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The criticism of the modern public
school is directed almost entirely at the
helplessness of children who are attempting
to enter industrial and commercial life from
this exclusive study period of eight, twelve,
or sixteen years in the schools, and at the fact
that the school is not able to get more than
half its children beyond the sixth grade of the
common school. Formerly the school plus the
home and small shop educated the child.
The small shop has been generally eliminated
and the home has lost most of its former
opportunities. A much greater part of the
education of the child must be assumed by the
school of the present generation. In place of
the school, home, and shop, we have the
school and the city street educating the great
masses of children. The school must do what
the school, home, and small shop formerly did
together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The idea of making the school a self-sustaining
community is worked out in the
Gary school in the most comprehensive form.
The manual-training and industrial shops, for
instance, are actually the shops for the school
community, and their work goes largely toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the upkeep of the school plant. Vocational
training in the Gary school means that
whatever work is necessary in the way of
repairing, conserving, beautifying, or enhancing
the school facilities is done by the pupils
themselves. The school, like the old-time
industrial home and community, has a large
amount of real work that is now being done
and must always be done in connection with
the equipment of its buildings, grounds, laboratories,
shops, etc. The large, lavishly
equipped Gary school plants require a force of
mechanics to keep them in repair. The usual
way of doing this would be to hire outside
labor at considerable expense to do the necessary
work during school vacations. The Gary
schools, on the other hand, which have no
long vacations, employ a permanent force of
mechanics, and keep them continuously employed
throughout the year. Regular union
artisans, chosen because of their character,
intelligence, and teaching ability, are engaged
by the building departments of the school
plant. There are carpenters, cabinet-makers,
painters, plumbers, sheet-metal workers, engineers,
printers, electricians, machinists, foundrymen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>etc., sufficient to meet the needs of
the schools. This great variety of equipment
and maintenance work provides manual activity
of a truly educative sort suitable to
every stage of the child’s development. The
shops of these workmen become the regular
manual and industrial training shops of the
school. The children work with the artisans
in much the same way as old-time apprentices,
though, of course, for only a fraction of
their time. Just as the child formerly participated
in the industrial activities of the household,
so now he participates in the real industrial
activities of his school. The school
artisans, and the nurses, school dentist,
and physician, landscape gardener, architect,
and draftsman, accountant, storekeeper, office
force, lunch-room manager, designer, dress-maker,
milliner, all take the place of the
father and mother and older brothers and
sisters in the old-time, self-sustaining, practically
educative household. The children
receive all the benefits of doing real work that
must be done and of participating in their own
school business. And they have the benefit of
a completely modern equipment resembling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>in detail the machinery and processes which
they will find when they go out into the larger
social community.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this novel scheme the Gary schools seem
to have experienced little difficulty. Superintendent
Wirt says that when you have provided
a plant where the children may live a
complete life eight hours a day in work, study,
and play, it is the simplest thing imaginable
to permit the children in the workshops,
under the direction and with the help of well-trained
men and women, to assume the responsibility
for the maintenance of the school
plant. There can be no exploitation of the
children, for masters and pupils are permitted
to do only enough work to balance the
wages of the masters and the cost of materials.
The teacher-workmen would be doing the
work whether the children assisted or not.
They earn their salaries by their repair and
construction work, and the children who desire
it get an admirably practical vocational
training almost without additional cost to the
city. The great expense is avoided of special
shop equipment, such as the usual industrial
high school or special trade school has for its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>industrial courses, which are, moreover,
wholly unproductive. And the school is able
to offer a much greater variety of trades than
even the special trade school: for a school
plant like the Gary institution will demand for
its equipment and maintenance almost every
staple trade, industrial and domestic, with the
attendant educational opportunities for both
boy and girl.</p>

<p class='c007'>Manual work takes on quite a new meaning
when it becomes, as in the Gary schools, productive
work for the school community. It
is no longer a question of each child doing his
“practice” work, his stereotyped “stunt,” in
which he soon loses interest. The boys in the
Gary carpenter-shop are making desks and
tables for the classrooms, cabinets and stools
for the laboratories, or bookracks for the
library. In the paint-shop they are staining
and finishing them; or they are at work on the
woodwork of the building, painting or varnishing.
The electricians must care for motors,
bells, etc., and there is always opportunity
for teaching winding, motor construction, and
wiring. Plumbing must be installed and kept
in repair. Many parts of the plant call for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>sheet-metal worker. Foundry and machine
workers require in turn a pattern-making
shop and draftsmen to furnish plans and specifications.
The engineer of the heating, lighting,
and ventilating plant gives lessons in
firing and in the care of boilers. The printing-shop
does all the printing work for the schools,—blanks,
forms, reports, charts, etc., besides
the illustrated brochures which the pupils of
the various departments issue. In the Froebel
School there is even a demand for a pottery
shop, where the children often discover artistic
talent in making the necessary clay utensils
for the school. The number and character
of the school shops is limited only by the
needs of the school community. One year the
shoeless condition of some of the children set
a demand for a shoe shop, in which old shoes
were made over into wearable new ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>The visitor to the Gary school finds everywhere
little groups of busy children, absorbedly
interested, working on the different
needs of the school, under kindly and intelligent
teacher-workmen. He finds that
there is enough real work in the school plant
to keep occupied for his hour or more a day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>every child who is interested in manual work—and
most children are—or who desires to
become familiar with a trade. Such work is
highly educational, and it is not drudgery. It
is not specialized, nor is it segregated from the
academic studies. The industrial work for both
boys and girls is an integral part of the school
life in which every one who cares for a
rounded education must participate in some
form or other.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE PRINTING-SHOP AT THE EMERSON SCHOOL</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>There is not a department which does not
contribute in some way to the school community
life. The caretakers of the grounds are
under the supervision of the botany and zoölogy
(nature-study) departments. The children
work with them in taking charge of and
caring for the gardens, lawns, trees, and
shrubs. The botany classes care also for the
school conservatory and for the smaller experimental
conservatory in the botany laboratory.
The zoölogy classes have charge of the
school zoo as well as the collection of pets in
the zoölogy room. Even the drawing classes
contribute, the mechanical-drawing pupils in
preparing plans for the industrial work and
construction, the art classes in decorating the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>friezes of their room or in designing details for
the building.</p>

<p class='c007'>Domestic science in the Gary school is not
taught as a separate “subject.” It means the
practical operation of the school lunch-room
under the direction of an instructor and a
cook assistant. The domestic-science room is
a real kitchen, dining-room, and pantry in
which the daily lunch is prepared and served
to such teachers and pupils as desire it. The
domestic-science work for the girls then consists
of nothing but this daily service, older
and younger girls coöperating with cook and
teacher. The salary of the assistant is paid
out of the profits of the lunch-room. Since the
food is sold, all expenses for supplies are
charged to the lunch department. The sewing-room
is operated on a similar plan. The
instructor has as assistants a practical dress-maker,
laundress, and milliner. Their salaries
and all materials used are paid for from the
savings made by doing the necessary laundry
and needlework for the school. Both cooking
and sewing departments are therefore <i>self-sustaining
school-community shops</i>. The school
board makes no appropriations for the support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>of the lunch-room, dressmaking, laundry,
and millinery departments other than the
salaries of the two head teachers. All bills are
paid directly by the department managers,
and no accounts are kept by the school
board. The other shops are self-supporting in
the sense that the ordinary appropriations
for painting, cabinet-work, electrical work,
plumbing, printing, etc. (which would have to
be paid anyway), generally pay the salaries of
the teacher-workmen and the costs of the
material. The ideal attainment would be to
make the shops all self-sustaining school-community
shops.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work of all these shops requires elaborate
systems of accounting. All this work is
taken charge of by the instructors and pupils
of the commercial departments of the school.
The work the children do in the shops is computed
on the basis of regular union wages for
the particular trade, and they are “paid” in
imitation checks, upon which their standing
in the course is based. For these payments
the commercial pupils manage a regular
school banking system, with savings accounts,
etc. They also have charge, under the instructors’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>supervision, of all the regular accounting
and secretarial work for the school administration.
Thus their bookkeeping, stenography,
and typewriting contribute directly to
the needs of the school. The commercial
pupils also take care of the ordering and distribution
of supplies. Some of these, such as
the coal and cement used in the schools, are
in turn tested by the chemistry classes in their
laboratory to see whether they come up to
specifications. The school “store” is as important
a feature of the school community as
the school “bank,” and the commercial pupils
take turns in “keeping” it. The criticism
that the pupils are incompetent to handle all
these matters is met by the obvious consideration
that the school cannot afford to graduate
pupils in accounting and secretarial work
who cannot perform these functions efficiently
for themselves and their school. At present, it
should be mentioned, these departments are
said not to be self-supporting, in the way that
the domestic-science shops are.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c007'>If the school is to be the children’s community,
there must be some place of general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>assembly, some forum or theater where the
school may take stock of itself. This is provided
in the “auditorium,” one of the original
and essential features of the Gary plan.
“Auditorium,” to which a daily hour is given,
is devoted to purposes different from the religious
exercises, declamations, and moral homilies
common to the “opening exercises” of
the ordinary school. It does not even open
the day, for the Gary program makes it necessary
for the “auditorium” hour to come at periods
throughout the day, differing for different
classes. The aim is to make it an occasion
where anything that is happening of peculiar
interest in any part of the school may be dramatically
brought to the attention of the rest
of the school. In the Gary school, each child
goes to “auditorium” for a full hour each day,
and listens to a program contributed by pupils
or teachers or outside visitors. There is always
choral singing; there may be instrumental
or phonograph music besides. Lantern-slides
and motion-pictures are often
shown. There may be talks by the special
teachers about their work. The child may see
there gymnastic exhibitions,—as has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>said, the stage at the Froebel School is so
large that a full-sized basketball game may be
played upon it before the audience,—folk-dancing,
or dramatic dialogues and little
plays written by the pupils themselves about
interesting things in their study or reading.
There may be debates on school issues. What
is to be presented in “auditorium” is limited
only by the imagination and expressiveness
of teachers and children. The teachers in turn
have the responsibility of arranging the program,
in coöperation with their pupils. Children
of widely different ages are sent together
to the “auditorium” hour, so that the
younger may have their curiosity stimulated
about the work of classes that they perhaps
have not yet reached, and so that the older
may lose that snobbery of age which often
causes so much unhappiness in childhood, and
tends to fill the adult mind with delusions
about the young. This plan, therefore, makes
for sympathy between the pupils, makes each
child familiar with the activities of the whole
school, and prevents that unfortunate segregation
and confinement of the ordinary school.
Besides being able to look into the various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>rooms through the glass doors, the child in the
Gary school has an opportunity of seeing in
“auditorium” in dramatic form the life of his
school. The influence of this “auditorium”
hour upon the school work, particularly the
academic work, can hardly fail to be marked,
for it directly motivates all the studies. It is
a sort of communal “application” activity.
History and literature take on a new meaning,
because the material may be studied now
always in the light of its possible presentation
to the rest of the school in dramatic and intelligent
form. Many schools use the dramatic
sense to vitalize these studies, but no other
school provides so definite and regular a focus,
and so constant and interested an audience
for the products of such a vitalization. The
“auditorium” in the Gary school seems to be
a genuine school-community theater, an inevitable
and integral part of the school life.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the words of Superintendent Wirt, the
Gary school aims to be a “clearing-house for
children’s activities.” The ideal is to render
the school community as self-sustaining and
self-stimulating as possible. Whatever the
school cannot itself contribute to the education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>of the child, it may find in the institutions
of the surrounding community. Any
outside agency which provides wholesome
activities for children becomes then a sort of
extension of the school. Children in the Gary
school are permitted to go out from their play
or “auditorium” hour to do special work at
home, take private music or art lessons, visit
the Y.M.C.A., settlement or neighborhood
house, attend the Boy Scouts or Camp-Fire
Girls, or receive religious instruction in the
churches. This outside work is then ranked as
an integral part of the school work.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is this community coöperation which has
particularly roused the interest of religious
educators. It suggests to many of them a solution
of the problems of religious education,
and of separate denominational schools. Religion
does not enter the Gary school in any
form, not even in Bible reading and prayer.
But children may go out, for one hour a day,
two, three, or even four times a week, to
classes in religious instruction, privately organized
and supported by the various
churches of the city. To meet the situation
in Gary, the churches have in some instances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>engaged special instructors for these classes in
religion. The Presbyterian, Methodist, and
Christian churches are said to have united in
engaging a teacher at a relatively high salary.
Such coöperation not only insures the services
of well-trained and liberal teachers, but must
necessarily banish sectarian dogmatism from
the teaching. In Gary, the Baptist, Roman
Catholic, and Hebrew churches, besides the
Y.M.C.A., are said to be giving this special
instruction. In the Jefferson School more
than half the children attend these classes at
the churches. This feature of the Gary plan
is one of the most interesting, and perhaps
has the most far-reaching possibilities, in the
way of transforming religious instruction in
this country. This plan is characteristic of a
school which seeks to meet the demands of
the individual child, and to make everything
in the community which is truly educational,
or which, for any reason, parents and children
believe to be genuinely educational, contribute
to the life of the school community.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since the other institutions have the same
privileges as the churches, they are all given
the opportunity in this plan of enlarging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>their effective resources. City schools which
wish to adopt the Gary plan, but lack the
ideal school plant or the varied facilities, may
often avail themselves of the gymnasium,
pools, playgrounds, etc., of near-by Y.M.C.A.
or settlement houses, and use the public
library and public playground, and thus acquire,
by systematic coöperation with these
other agencies, an effectively working Gary
school. This plan has been adopted with
great success in the case of the New York
schools, a number of which are in the course
of adopting the Gary plan, or many features
of it. Their experience has shown that, by
making the school a “clearing-house for children’s
activities,” the social resources of all
these communal institutions are vastly increased.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c007'>To sum up, the Gary school forms a children’s
community, which aims to provide the
practical natural education of the old school,
shop, and home which educated our forefathers.
It is a necessary evolution and reorganization
of the public school to meet the
changed social and industrial conditions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>the modern city. The school community, by
providing a fourfold activity of work, study,
and play, uses the children’s time and keeps
them from the demoralizing influence of the
streets. In the “auditorium” it provides a
public theater which may motivate all the
work and study. By coöperating with all the
community agencies which provide wholesome
activities for children, it makes them
all more valuable and effective. And by
making the school as far as possible a self-sustaining
community, it gives meaning and
purpose to all the work, trains the children
for the outside world, and cultivates the social
virtues.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>IV<br /> <br /><span class='c020'>PROGRAMS: THE SCHOOL AS A PUBLIC UTILITY</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Schools</span> such as those in Gary, with their
elaborate equipment and special school enterprises,
obviously require methods of financing
radically different from those of the
ordinary public school. It is, perhaps, this
problem of how a small and relatively poor
city like Gary could afford to maintain such
schools that has aroused the interest of practical
school men in the Gary plan. When the
public schools were first started in the new
town, the authorities found themselves in a
peculiarly difficult situation, owing to the
limited funds at hand and the demands of a
rapidly increasing population. The conventional
method of meeting the situation would
have been to erect inferior buildings, to omit
playgrounds, laboratories, workshops, to employ
cheap teachers, to increase the size of
classes, to limit the yearly term, or else to try
to accommodate all the children in a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>buildings on half-time work. These have
been the methods which our large cities have
almost universally felt themselves obliged to
adopt when confronted with these problems
of economy and congestion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other possible method—and this
seems to be the unique contribution of the
Gary plan to the economics of education—was
to treat the public school as a public
service, and apply to it all those principles
of scientific direction which have been perfected
for the public use of railroads, telephones,
parks, and other “public utilities.”
The new city of Gary could create thoroughly
modern, completely equipped school
plants, and operate them so as to get the
maximum of service from them. Superintendent
Wirt and the school board believed
that this plan would be the true economy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Wirt says, “You can afford any kind
of school desired if ordinary economic public-service
principles are applied to public-school
management. The first principle in turning
waste into profit in school management is to
use every facility all the time for all the people.”
Instead, therefore, of counting their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>financial resources and then deciding what
limited educational facilities could be provided
with them, the Gary authorities seem
to have decided upon the ideal school plant
desired to meet the needs of the modern city
child, and then to have proceeded, by the
ingenious application of principles well recognized
in business and industry, to utilize
their resources so as to support the desired
facilities. The Gary plan has made evident
the great wastes involved in the conventional
methods of managing the public-school plant.
All school men will agree with Superintendent
Wirt when he says that “most certainly
playgrounds, gymnasiums, and swimming-pools
are good things for all children to have.
I believe that gardens, workshops, drawing
and music studios are good things for children
to have. I believe that museums, art galleries,
and libraries are good things for children
to use systematically and regularly. In my
judgment opportunities for religious instruction,
for private instruction in music, and for
assisting in desirable home work are good
things for children. So also are coöperative
classes between the academic school and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>industrial activities of the school business
departments, and between the school and
industrial activities outside the school. In
what way will the use of these facilities handicap
a child in his efforts to secure an education?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer is, of course, “in no way.”
These are the things the most advanced
higher schools and wealthy private schools
are providing for their pupils. School men
may have desired to provide all these things
for all the children of the elementary schools
too, but rarely has economic skill combined
with educational philosophy to bring such an
ideal within the bounds of possibility. The
Gary school seems to have found a way. It
has actually realized the ideal, and made
practicable that school-community life which
other schools have only envisaged. It has
found that any kind of school desired may be
had if classrooms, auditoriums, playgrounds,
etc., are in constant use all day long by all the
children in alternating groups and out of
school hours by adults.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The modern city,” says Superintendent
Wirt, “is largely the result of the application
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of the principle of the common use of public
facilities that we need for our personal use
only part of the time. We are willing that
other people use public services when we cannot
use them. How many street-cars and
what sort of service could we afford if each
citizen had to have his own private street-car
seat for his own exclusive use?” Yet the
educational ideal in school management generally
remains what is set forth in the report
of the 1913 Part-Time Committee of the New
York public schools,—“Every pupil is entitled
to an individual seat and desk. The
teacher is entitled to the exclusive possession
of a classroom....”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the light of the Gary plan this ideal is
absurd. It means, as has been discovered in
the New York experience, that school facilities
can never be made to catch up to school
population. And it is absurd because it assumes
that all persons in school want to do
the same thing at the same time. But all
“modern public conveniences are made possible
only by their common use and the fact
that we do not want to use the same public
conveniences at the same moment. We are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>willing to have some one else use our public
library, look at our pictures in our public
museum, walk in our public park, sleep in our
Pullman berth or in our hotel bedroom, or
travel in our steamboat when we are otherwise
engaged.” It proves to be as financially
prohibitive to attempt to provide an individual
desk and seat for every school-child as it
is to provide an individual seat for every citizen
who may sit in the park. “The great
masses of children in our city schools can never
have ample play spaces, suitable auditoriums,
gymnasiums and swimming-pools, workshops,
libraries, museums, or even ordinary schoolrooms
for study and recitation, if all children
at the same time must be using each of these
facilities separately.” The more people use
these public services, the cheaper they become
for each one of us. And the more evenly
the public use is distributed, the more valuable
becomes the service to each one of us.
“Increasing the number of persons using any
public facility either under public or private
ownership betters the service for all, provided
the load can be uniformly distributed during
operating hours. The problem with a public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>lighting or transportation service is to eliminate
‘peak-loads’ as far as possible.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have had constantly before us the
gradual extension of the principle of multiple
service of public facilities. The Gary plan
makes the public school the last of these public
services to come under the operation of
these principles. As generally managed the
public school has not recognized these principles.
The effect of its administrative methods,
its rigid school hours, its uniform curriculum,
its emphasis on academic work, has
been rather to increase the “peak-loads”
and thus inadvertently to increase the costs of
operation. In many schools, the use of the
“auditorium” does not average more than ten
minutes a day for each day of the year, and
the playgrounds barely an hour each day of
the year. And for every hour that shops, etc.,
are empty, there is a waste and leakage,
which would be permitted in no other public-service
institution.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gary plan, therefore, has worked out a
multiple use of the school plant in the most
comprehensive form. By distributing classes
in alternating groups, so that every department
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>and room is in use as nearly as possible
every hour of the eight-hour day, the “peak-loads”
are prevented and the costs of operation
reduced to the minimum. This system,
variously called a “rotation-of-crops” or a
“platoon” system, permits almost the actual
doubling of the capacity of the school plant.
Two duplicate schools may function together
in the same building all day long. This “duplicate-school”
plan is not, it must be observed,
that used in some cities, where one
school occupies the rooms for a few hours
while the other remains at home, to take its
turn in the rooms while the other goes out.
That is merely a “part-time” scheme, and
only accentuates the usual evils of fragmentary
schooling and demoralizing street life.
The Gary plan involves two distinct schools,
known as the “X” and the “Y” schools, each
of which has the entire program and the full
day. The Gary plan, in other words, can accommodate
twice the ordinary number in a
school-building, not by shortening the time
for each child, but actually by lengthening it.</p>

<p class='c007'>How this plan works out in detail for a
school unit of eight classes may be shown by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>the following program, which was used in the
Jefferson School when Superintendent Wirt
first came to Gary. The Jefferson School has
been described as a conventional school-building,
which was adapted to the Gary
plan by the institution of shops, gymnasium,
etc., and the conversion of classrooms into
laboratories and studios. The program shows
how a small eight-room school, ordinarily
accommodating three hundred and twenty
children (forty to a class), may, with a small
auditorium, playground, attic gymnasium,
and basement shops accommodate two duplicate
schools of eight teachers each, with a
total of six hundred and forty children.
The first column gives the teachers,—grade
teachers for the regular studies of the eight
grades, and special teachers for the special
activities. The second column gives the
rooms where the work is conducted; the
other columns give the distribution of time.
“1X” means the first grade of the “X”
school; “1Y” means the first grade of the “Y”
school, etc. The program shows the ingenious
distribution of classes throughout the
school and throughout the course of the day,—six
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>hours in this case, to which one hour
and a quarter must be added for lunch-time.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to this program, only eight
regular schoolrooms are required for the sixteen
classes. While these eight classrooms
are occupied by the classes engaged in the
regular studies, the eight other classes are
engaged in special activities in other parts of
the school plant, in basement shops, attic
gymnasium, or playground. Half the day is
given to the regular studies, and half to the
special activities. The regular studies occupy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>two periods of ninety minutes each, one in
the forenoon and one in the afternoon. The
same amount of time is given to the special
activities, but the ninety-minute periods are
divided into two forty-five-minute periods.
The time devoted to the regular studies is
divided as the teachers see fit. Each teacher
has but one class at a time, and the way in
which the time is distributed between the
arithmetic, reading, spelling, geography,
history, etc., depends upon the needs of those
in the class. It will be seen from the program
that each class of the two duplicate schools
has time not only for three hours a day of the
traditional school studies, but for three hours
of play and special activities besides. And
since this is the daily program, each class
gets this varied work, study, and play every
day, and not, as is the case of the special
work in most public schools, only once or
twice a week. Thus, according to this program,
the day’s work for the third grade in
the “X” school would be mapped out in this
way,—regular studies, drawing or manual
training, playground or gymnasium, lunch,
regular studies, music, and playground again.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>The sixth grade in the “Y” school has a
program of physical education, music or literature,
regular studies, lunch, play, science
or manual arts, and regular studies again.
The program shows not only how double the
number of classes are accommodated, but
how all are given a longer and more varied
day than is possible in the ordinary school.</p>

<p class='c007'>This program represents the simplest
framework of the application of public-service
principles to the daily school program,
with its multiple use of facilities. It is
known as the “Old Gary School Program,”
and has, of course, been much modified and
refined and complicated as the need for flexibility
and for the further departmentalizing
of studies has arisen, and as it has had to be
adapted to schools of different sizes. As here
presented it does not include the high-school
classes. The program of the complete school
plant is much more elaborate. The “Old
Gary School Program,” however, contains
the essential principles of the distribution of
classes and of school time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since September, 1913, a new and more
satisfactory program has been followed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>four larger Gary schools. The new school day
is eight and one quarter hours in length, and
the work is divided into four groups, as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>Since C D, or the “Y” school, has physical
education the first hour in the morning, and
A B, or the “X” school, has it the last hour
of the afternoon, pupils in the “Y” school
are permitted to come an hour later in the
morning, and the pupils in the “X” school
are permitted to leave an hour earlier in the
afternoon. It will be observed from this program
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>that only one fourth of the pupils are
engaged in group 1 during any hour of the
day. Four separate classes are, therefore,
accommodated in each regular classroom.
Consequently, the capacity of the school
plant is four times that of the regular classrooms.
But since a number of rooms which
would otherwise be used for classrooms are
used for laboratories and studios, the net
capacity of the school plant operating under
the new program is, as under the old program,
twice the capacity of the total number
of classrooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the lower grades it is found desirable to
use for formal physical training, half an hour
out of the two hours assigned to group 2.
An exchange is, therefore, made with the
grammar and high-school grades, which are
assigned to the regular classrooms for an
additional hour of English and mathematics.
In all grades the time assigned to group 4 is
divided between the teachers of physical
education and play, and the teachers of the
subjects in groups 1 and 2. In the lower
grades, teachers of the regular studies use
their share of the time—one hour—in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>games and constructive plays that apply the
subject-matter taught in the classes. This is
the “application” work which is so distinctive
a feature of the Gary school. It is planned
systematically to give the formal work of the
school opportunity for expression through
activity. The music and literature teachers
use the “application” period for folk-dances,
musical games, dramatics, modeling in clay
and sand, and for free imaginative play and
construction. This “application” work is
carried on informally in the broad halls or in
corners of the playgrounds and playrooms.
Whatever work has permanent value or interest
may then be practiced for presentation
in the “auditorium” period. The nature-study
and science teachers use the application
period for the care of the lawns, trees,
shrubbery, the conservatories, the gardens,
the animal pets. In the upper grades, mathematics
teachers use this period for the practical
measuring and planning of the various
mechanical construction projects of the shops
or grounds, or in practical accounting in connection
with the clerical work of the school.
In other words, it is in the “application”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>periods that that work is done which contributes
to the school community life which
has been described in the chapter on “The
School as a Community.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the lower grades, “application” takes
largely the form of games. In the upper
grades, the industrial and science work is
used as the basis. Practical instruction is
given by the shop and laboratory teachers, in
addition to that given by the regular teachers.
The special teacher has his pupils for one
hour in the classroom, followed by two hours
in the shop or laboratory where direct application
is made of the theoretical instruction.
This extra time is taken out of that assigned
to group 4.</p>

<p class='c007'>The division of time between the various
activities in the new program therefore works
out as follows:—</p>

<p class='c010'>This is the new program for a school of
eight grades. In the case of the complete
school plant, such as those of the Emerson
and Froebel Schools in Gary, with their
twelve grades and their forty or more classes
apiece, the program becomes much more
complicated. But the division of time follows
essentially the outlines given above,
the high-school classes resembling the upper
grammar grades’ distribution of time and
subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>The noteworthy thing about this program,
apart from the ingenious and successful multiple
use of the school plant it represents, is
the equable distribution of time between the
“regular studies” and the “special activities.”
In the Gary school, the “special
work,” more or less an appendage in the ordinary
public school, is as regular as the “regular
work.” Yet the amount of academic work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>is no less than that in the ordinary schools.
The various fundamental groups are participated
in on equal terms. No subject is
slighted, no age is slighted. The extended
school day, which absorbs the “street and
alley time” of the city child, affords ample
opportunity for all activities. No activity
is continued long enough to cause fatigue,
while the constant daily cultivation of each
activity provides the constant drill and the
thoroughness of training which the ordinary
school, with its short day and crowded curriculum,
is compelled to slight. Such a program
seems to be a highly rational distribution
of school activities, as ingenious from the
point of view of educational engineering as it
is pedagogically sound. By treating the daily
use of the schools as a public service, the
Gary program obtains, for twice the number
of children ordinarily accommodated, twice
the number of facilities ordinarily provided.
Each individual is immensely benefited because
all are served. “The only reason why
the public—that is, ourselves collectively—can
afford to provide things for each of us
individually that we cannot provide for ourselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>privately, is that collectively we secure
a multiple use of the facilities.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The same principles of administrative
economy—an economy which creates rather
than impoverishes—are applied to the
yearly schedule as to the daily program.
The Gary authorities find that they cannot
afford to let their plant stand idle two or
three months of the year, and are therefore
working toward an all-year school. This
effort coincides with a growing general belief
that the long summer vacations not only demoralize
the city child, but are a great waste
of educational influence. At the present
time state laws hinder the completion of the
all-year plan. The Gary schools now have
ten months of regular compulsory school, and
ten weeks of voluntary vacation school, but
they are working toward an organization of
four quarters of twelve weeks each. This
plan was approximated by Superintendent
Wirt in the Bluffton schools before he came to
Gary. Under this scheme pupils are required
to attend any three of the four quarters, attendance
in the remaining quarter being
wholly voluntary. In Bluffton it was found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>that the attendance of the younger children
for the summer quarter was greater than for
any other quarter in the year. With the
traditional term organization, many children
are unavoidably absent in the winter on account
of sickness and weather. Under the
four-quarter arrangement, however, the allotted
vacation of these children could be so
organized as to include this absence and thus
insure thirty-six weeks of schooling. “When
people are given a chance,” says Superintendent
Wirt, “it is found that they do not
want to go to school at the same time any
more than they all want to travel at the same
time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The all-year school would not increase the
cost of maintenance. For with the same
number of pupils per teacher, the cost is the
same whether the pupils are all taught together
for thirty-six weeks, on the traditional
plan, or whether only three quarters of them
are taught at a time throughout a school
year of forty-eight weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>The economies which this multiple use of
school facilities effects are so large as to provide
ample funds for all the special features
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>of the Gary plan of education. These savings
are in construction, in operation and maintenance,
and in instruction. Savings in construction
alone are very large. Since, under
the duplicate-school plan, two complete
schools may be accommodated in one building,
the number of school plants may be
greatly reduced. In the light of the Gary
plan, therefore, those cities which are confronted
with problems of school congestion
are in the paradoxical situation of having,
not too few buildings, but actually too many.
Fewer and better plants would accommodate
their children under the Gary plan. It must
be remembered that the Gary schools at
present have accommodations for many
more children than there are children to use
them, and this in spite of a phenomenal
growth of population. The erection of a
number of Gary unit plants is less expensive
than the erection of a much larger number of
ordinary school-buildings of the common
school type. For the cost of building construction
does not increase in proportion to
the size of the building, and large sums may
be saved on the fewer sites required. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>diminution in the number of classrooms in
the Gary school plant is a distinct source of
economy, owing to the fact that the classroom
is uniformly the most expensive portion of the
school plant. The Gary experience seems to
show that the best and completest unit school
plant is also the cheapest. The plan of having
the twelve grades under one roof avoids the
reduplication of expensive equipment in several
centers. And the self-sustaining industrial
shops cut off an item of “vocational
training” expense which most cities find almost
financially prohibitive.</p>

<p class='c007'>As for the costs of operation and maintenance,
it is obvious that increasing the size
of the school plant makes for economy. The
cost of janitor service, administrative charges,
heating, lighting, etc., are much reduced by
consolidation. Nor, in order to effect these
economies, need the size of the school plant
be made so large as to make administration
unwieldy. The largest Gary school plant, operating
with all these economies, accommodates
only twenty-seven hundred children,
forty children to a teacher, while it is the
intention to reduce the average number of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>children per teacher to thirty, and the building
capacity to two thousand children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, the cost per pupil for instruction is
decreased by the plan of specializing and
departmentalizing the work, and thus eliminating
overhead charges for supervisors. It
should be pointed out again that <i>all these
economies actually increase the educational
efficiencies of the school</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The figures show that the Gary school
plan does not increase public expenditures for
educational purposes. The Jefferson School,
built before Superintendent Wirt came to
Gary, and representing the common type of
modern school-building, was erected at a
cost of $90,000 to accommodate 360 pupils,
with 40 pupils per teacher. This is a <i>per-capita</i>
construction cost of $250, a cost exactly
equal to that of a typical New Jersey
High School recently erected at a cost of
$125,000, with a maximum capacity of 500
pupils. The capacity of the Emerson School,
constructed as an ideal Gary school plant, is
1800, with 30 pupils to a teacher. Its cost,
with a large playground and the wealth of
facilities already described, was about $300,000.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>The <i>per-capita</i> cost of construction was
therefore $166. At its maximum capacity,
with 40 pupils to the teacher, the <i>per-capita</i>
cost of construction would be only $111, as
against $250 for the Jefferson School, with
no facilities. Further tables of comparative
costs will be found in the Appendix.</p>

<p class='c007'>The funds liberated by the application of
these simple economical principles to public-school
finance are so large as to give Gary the
means to provide, as Superintendent Wirt
says, “any kind of a school desired.” Extraordinarily
complete educational and recreational
facilities may be furnished for all the
people all the year round. Money is thus
provided for an evening school for adults on
an almost unprecedented scale. The Gary
evening schools, held in the four largest
school plants, four evenings a week throughout
the regular school year from 7 to 9.30
<span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, have an attendance over two thirds
that of the regular day schools. The cost of
the evening school is only thirteen per cent of
the day-school cost.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evening schools of Gary resemble a
people’s university. Practically every study
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>authorized by state law is given, and the
bulletin of courses is like a university catalogue.
All the shops, laboratories, studios,
and classrooms are thrown open, either to
repeat the day studies or to present more
advanced work. All the work, industrial and
academic, is open on equal terms to men
and women. During 1914-15, 4300 students,
representing all classes in the community,
are said to have been enrolled in the Gary
evening schools, with an average monthly
enrollment of 3103. Over two thousand of the
nine thousand voters at the last city election
were said to be enrolled in the Gary evening
schools. There are said to be more men over
twenty-one attending evening schools in
Gary than there are boys of all ages attending
the day schools.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gary evening schools in the last year
have achieved an even closer articulation of
the work of the day and evening schools. A
large number of short-unit courses were offered
for busy men and women who wished
particular branches of certain studies, and
who could not remain in school to pursue their
studies in the usual way. It has also been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>arranged to connect into group units the
studies that bear upon a given industrial occupation,
so that the school may correlate
directly with all the occupations of the community,
and the adult worker may come and
secure the additional experimentation or theory
which will help him in his work.</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to this instruction offered in
academic and industrial work, to the evening
pupils is given free use of the gymnasiums,
pools, playgrounds, etc. The playgrounds are
artificially lighted so that games may be
played successfully at night. Playgrounds
and swimming-pools are open on Sundays
also, and the auditoriums for lectures, moving
pictures, community forums, and the
like. All wholesome social gatherings and
entertainments are welcomed any evening of
the week. The auditoriums are freely lent for
political meetings, conferences, meetings of
neighborhood or other private associations.
The Gary school plant thus becomes in the
fullest sense a social or community center.
The “wider use of the school plant” here involves
almost the widest possible use in the
interests of all classes of the population; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>the lavish Gary school plants contain equipments
which serve the needs not only of children,
but of all classes of adults as well, from
the well-to-do woman who wishes to learn
French to the sheet-metal worker in the
mills.</p>

<p class='c007'>By using the schools as a public service, the
Gary educational authorities are thus able to
provide for all the people facilities at no
more expense than other communities are
paying now for meager opportunities which
do not even meet the needs of the children,
while they leave the majority of adults entirely
uninfluenced by the schools. “The
private exclusive use of public-school facilities
has meant and will continue to mean,” says
Superintendent Wirt, “that all of the people
collectively can provide for only a part of
their number.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gary school is evidently a genuine
“public school” in a sense more “public”
than is generally known. In many communities
the public school is “still the old private
school publicly supported.” School boards
often act as if they were trustees of private
property. They gravely discuss “wider use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>of the school plant” as if this were some gracious
extension of privilege instead of a public
right. The public in many communities
scarcely feel yet that the schools are their
own. The Gary schools seem to have produced
a different spirit. They are public in
the same broad sense that streets and parks
are public. They are used with the same
freedom and lack of reserve. In such a community
and such a school education would
never be finished. Just as there is no break
between common school and high school in
the Gary plan, so there need be none between
child and adult. The child would not
“graduate,” “complete his or her education,”
but would tend to drift back constantly to
the school to get the help he or she needed in
profession or occupation, or to keep on enjoying
the facilities which even the wealthy
private home would not be able or willing to
afford. It is toward such a public educational
ideal that the Gary plan seems to work.
Toward this all the economies and ingenious
schemes of organization are directed—toward
making the public schools veritable
“schools of the public.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h2 class='c009'>V<br /> <br /><span class='c020'>ORGANIZATION</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> distinctive features of organization in
the Gary school are the separation of administrative
from pedagogical supervision;
the extension of departmental teaching
throughout the entire school; the increased
initiative and coöperation of the teaching
force; the flexibility and simplicity obtained
by the “helper” or “observer” system.</p>

<p class='c007'>The school administration is vested in a
single head, the superintendent of schools,
who is appointed by the board of education
of three members. In charge of each school-building
is an executive principal, whose
duties are concerned with program-making,
with supervision of the pupil’s schedules,
with the general maintenance of order and
discipline, and ordinary administrative work.
He has no supervision of the instruction.</p>

<p class='c007'>For all the schools there are two general
supervisors of instruction, who oversee the
teaching, work out the curricula in coöperation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>with the teachers, conduct examinations
for promotion, make promotions or demotions
after consultation with the teacher.</p>

<p class='c007'>The industrial and manual-training shops
are under the direction of a director of industrial
work, who is also practical head of
the school-building and repair department.
The teacher-workmen in the shops are employed
by him in the dual capacity of manual-training
and industrial teachers and of regular
workmen engaged in repair and construction.
Each building has a head manual-training
teacher, who supervises the work of the industrial
classes, of the part-time classes, and
acts as vocational adviser for the school’s
pupils. Gymnasium and swimming-pool attendants
are employed by the head teachers
of the physical education departments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The departmental teachers in the head
building (Emerson School) act as assistant
supervisors of instruction in their subjects
and have general oversight of the courses in
their subjects as taught in the other buildings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Departmental teaching is carried out in
the Gary schools to an extent generally unrealized
in other public schools. It is considered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>that, with the exception of the lowest
grades, no arguments which apply to the institution
of departmental teaching in the
high school are inapplicable to the grades of
the common school. The special activities
undoubtedly call for specialists to conduct
them. History, language, literature, mathematics
can also be much better taught if the
teacher can devote his or her attention to
the particular methods and orientation of the
respective subjects, and not be required to be
equally at home in the technique of all of
them. Teachers can rarely be found who are
many-sided enough to teach well even all the
common branches, without the special activities.
The Gary schools, therefore, adopt
for all, except the first two or three grades,
what are practically advanced high-school or
college methods of specialized teaching.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>THE MACHINE-SHOP AT THE EMERSON SCHOOL</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In these lowest grades all the regular subjects
are taught by the one grade teacher; in
the other grades practically all the subjects
are departmentalized. A unit school plant
which should have fifty-six classes, divided
proportionately among the grades, in addition
to the nurseries and kindergartens and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>special classes, would employ for grades 1 to
3, <i>sixteen</i> teachers, as follows: For English,
mathematics, 8; for manual training, 2; for
nature-study, 2; for music, 1; for expression,
1; for physical training, 2.</p>

<p class='c007'>For grades 4 to 12, <i>forty-six</i> teachers would
be employed: For English, 4; for mathematics,
2; for Latin, 1; for German, 1; for French,
1; for Spanish, 1; for history, 1; for fourth-and
fifth-grade English, mathematics, history,
and geography (either departmentalized or
undepartmentalized), 8; for chemistry, 2;
for botany, 2; for physics, 2; for zoölogy, 2;
for freehand drawing, 2; for architectural
drawing, 2; for mechanical drawing, 1; for
music, 2; for expression, 2; for cooking, 1; for
sewing, 1; for manual training (not including
the industrial shops), 2; for physical training,
6. Four teachers would be employed in the
kindergarten department. A unit plant of
this size would require one executive building
principal, and one supervisor of instruction.
Two school nurses and a school physician
would also be employed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a distribution of the teaching force
would be considered the ideal for a unit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>school plant of all grades, accommodating
between fourteen hundred and twenty-two
hundred and fifty children in two duplicate
schools. It will be observed that this most
careful specialization of teaching does not
increase the number of teachers required. At
least fifty-six teachers, with a number of
special teachers, would be required in any
school of fifty-six classes, run on an undepartmentalized
plan. The Gary plan, therefore,
without increasing the number of teachers,
provides for a much higher expertness of
service. Indeed, Superintendent Wirt has
worked out a form by which a school of
thirty-two classes would only require thirty-two
teachers, including the special teachers,
and with most of the work departmentalized.</p>

<p class='c007'>Programs may be arranged for schools
with any number of classes. The number of
classrooms and teachers required will be approximately
as follows, including supervisors,
special teachers, librarians and playground
instructors:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c030'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>A 12-class school requires  8 classrooms and 12 teachers.</div>
      <div class='line'>A 24-class school requires 15 classrooms and 23 teachers.</div>
      <div class='line'>A 36-class school requires 22 classrooms and 33 teachers.</div>
      <div class='line'>A 48-class school requires 29 classrooms and 43 teachers.</div>
      <div class='line'>A 60-class school requires 36 classrooms and 54 teachers.</div>
      <div class='line'>A 72-class school requires 43 classrooms and 64 teachers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>In the 72-class school, 43 classrooms and
54 teachers are required, in addition to the
provision for auditorium, playrooms, and library.
For this work 10 teachers are required,
making a total of only 64 teachers for 72
classes. The traditional elementary school
requires 72 teachers and 72 classrooms for 72
classes; the manual-training shops and the
manual-training teachers are extra. In addition
there would be librarians in branch public
libraries, playground directors in public
playgrounds, and special teachers as supervisors
of music, drawing, physical training,
manual training, and nature-study. Often in
the traditional school 80 or more persons are
employed for the instruction of 72 classes,
not including the building principal and
assistants.</p>

<p class='c007'>An important feature of the teacher organization
in the Gary school is the division into
senior and junior teachers, or head teacher
and assistant teacher. Since each classroom
accommodates two teachers according to the
duplicate-school plan, the teacher who has
been longer in service is designated as head
teacher. The less experienced teacher acts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>under her direction. The head teachers, for
instance, in the “X” school may visit and
criticize the work of the assistant teachers in
the “Y” school during the last hour of the
day when the “X” school is not in session.
Similarly the junior teacher in the “Y”
school may visit the work of the “X” school
during the first hour. Inexperienced or weak
teachers may thus be developed under the
direction of the more experienced. New
teachers are thus being constantly trained in
the new régime and spirit of the Gary school.
The school is thus made an extension of the
normal or training-school for teachers. The
teachers continue to learn as well as the pupils.
The question how teachers are to be
procured for the new demands which the
Gary plan puts upon them is thus answered.
The school itself trains the teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The responsibilities of the teachers for the
auditorium period have been discussed. Under
the old Gary plan each auditorium period
was in charge of one teacher who acted as
assistant principal. The teachers alternated
in organizing the dramatic and other features
of the auditorium work. Recently Superintendent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Wirt has decided that this auditorium
work functions better if it is specialized. In
the new 72-school program, four teachers
give their time exclusively to the auditorium
exercises. One teacher has charge of the
music; one has charge of the art, literature,
history, civics, and current events; one has
charge of the presentation of material relating
to the science work; and one has charge of the
presentation of the material relating to the
shops and industries. In a properly equipped
auditorium, with stereopticon lantern, motion-picture
machine, stage, player-piano, organ,
and phonograph, the auditorium teachers
can do many things better with large
numbers of children than the regular teachers
can do with small numbers. The regular
classroom teachers are expected to coöperate
in this frequent presentation of work by their
classes in the auditorium in order to use it
as a place for “application” work and for
motivating the academic work of the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the new program, the “application”
work is also specialized. Experience has
shown that some teachers have a special
talent for this imaginative and constructive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>side of teaching, and prefer to devote their
entire time to it. In this scheme, the “application”
teachers have six classes daily out of
a total of twelve classes in each of their respective
groups. They are thus able to meet
each of the twelve classes of their respective
groups every other day, week, month, or
term. Or these teachers may select from each
of the groups of three classes the pupils who
need special work in language and mathematics,
and meet these pupils every day.
For the average pupil all of the opportunity
necessary to make an application of his
language and mathematics is provided in
the regular manual-training, drawing, music,
and expression classes. The “application”
teachers meet their respective classes in the
manual-training, drawing, music, and expression
rooms. The facilities of these special
rooms are used for “application” purposes.
The “application” teachers are expected to
make suggestions to the special teachers of
these subjects concerning the opportunities
to teach language and mathematics through
the “application” opportunities of the regular
work of their respective subjects. Each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“application” teacher may be constituted the
head of a group of eight teachers. The “application”
teacher is the correlating agent for
all the work of the twelve classes; also she
works with all of the twelve classes as a constructive
examiner, and is constantly placing
before the children real problems of the type
that the world of industry, business, and
citizenship will place before them when they
leave school. She may not be able to present
these problems as well as the world will present
them later, but the immediate and daily
reaction while the child is in school should be
invaluable in preparing him for meeting the
more difficult problems which arise when he
has completed his school course.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c007'>Class periods may be 40 or 50 or 55 minutes
instead of 60. Teachers have six hours in
school with 60-minute periods, five and one-half
with 55-minute periods, and five hours
with 50-minute periods. Pupils have a school
day of seven, six and one-half, and six hours
respectively, in addition to an hour for luncheon.
The playground teachers are on duty
an additional hour. Each teacher has an hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>a day free for her own work. When her day is
finished, she is supposed to leave the building.
It is expected that all paper work, as well as
all the work of the children, will be done in
school. The purpose is to make the teacher’s
day only six hours, without the burden of
extra time at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>An interesting extension of this teacher-organization
plan is the new training course
for outside teachers or principals who are
desirous of studying the Gary school plan
and teaching methods. Visiting teachers and
principals are allowed, at a fee, to attach
themselves as assistants to teachers or principals,
and follow the work through a course
of weeks or months, in exactly the same way
that the small child acts as “helper” or “observer”
to the older child in the laboratory or
shop or the junior to the senior teacher. The
fee goes to the teacher or principal who instructs
the visitor. This novel way of teaching
the principles of the Gary school, not by lectures,
but by direct practical assistance on
the part of the visitor, is typical of that insistence
upon “learning by doing” which is
the keynote of the Gary instruction.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>The Gary plan acts on the theory that the
good teachers should be given initiative and
responsibility, while the inexperienced and
weak teachers should be trained into initiative
and responsibility. The usual plan in
school systems is to make the experienced
and inexperienced, strong and weak, coördinate
with one another, and all subordinate to
the supervisor or superintendent. The Gary
plan thus secures the utmost from the good
teachers, and trains the poor ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instead of employing special “visiting
teachers,” as is done in many school systems,
the teacher in the Gary school is given the
responsibilities of the “visiting teacher” by
being made a “register teacher” for a subdivision
of the school district. In this way
cases of maladjustment to school, home, or
neighborhood conditions may be met. The
school population of the city is geographically
districted in such a way that each district
holds about fifty families. The children
in a district are assigned, irrespective of age
or grade, to one of the grade teachers. Each
“register teacher” meets her group once a
week for general conference. She gives out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>the monthly reports. Failure in self-control,
irregular attendance, tardiness, and other
matters are reported to her. No child is excused
from class without her permission, and
she is expected to call at the homes of the
children when necessary or to meet their
parents at the school. Each “register
teacher” holds the same children from class
to class as long as they live in the district.
She corresponds almost exactly to what is
known as the “faculty adviser” of the college
student, a guide and friend for the general
conduct of school life and for difficulties
that arise. The “register teacher” is a sort of
disciplinary and sociological overseer for a
group of children living in the same neighborhood.
She has a set of blanks which in fact
provide a basis for a complete sociological
survey of her district. These she is supposed
to fill in, as facts about living conditions,
etc., come to her attention. It seems evident
that this work, while exacting, involves no
more than a teacher should know. No more
valuable sociological training could be imagined
for the intelligent and progressive
teacher. Such work relates her at once to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>general community life, and makes her profession
of a far more serious importance than
is usually given to the grade teachers in the
public schools. This work is typical of the
demands for a new initiative and intelligence
that the Gary plan makes upon the teachers,
and also of the immense educative value of
these demands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The effort is constantly made in the Gary
schools to bridge the gap between teacher and
pupil. An important recent innovation is the
institution of “teachers’ assistants.” Students
in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades
have ten weeks for drawing, ten weeks for
science, ten weeks for shopwork, and ten
weeks for service as “teachers’ assistants.”
The students act as laboratory and studio
assistants only in the departments in which
they have a special interest. Three or four
students assist the science teachers, three or
four the drawing teachers, and three or four
the shop teachers. Playground teachers,
auditorium teachers, music teachers, etc.,
have as assistants the students especially interested.
Each student can, therefore, receive
twenty weeks of work in the department
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>in which he has a special interest. Many
teachers confess that the first year of teaching
gave them a much clearer grasp of the
subjects they taught than they were able to
secure as students. From the point of view of
scholarship, the teachers’ assistants learn
more by acting in this rôle for a limited time
than they could learn by using the time for
additional study. They not only learn how
to take initiative and assume responsibility,
but they enable the teacher to do much more
effective work with the regular classes.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c007'>This same fundamental principle of organization
is applied to the pupils themselves in
their relations with one another. Fourth- and
fifth-grade pupils are considered too old for
the primary manual training and nature-study,
and not quite old enough to use profitably
the laboratories and workshops as
independent students. They are, therefore,
assigned as assistants to students in the
higher classes. These children in this way
learn more by working with the older students
than they can be taught in separate classes by
themselves. Not only does the younger child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>learn by helping the older and watching him
and asking questions of him, but the older
learns by being required to answer the questions
and make the younger child understand
what he is doing in shop or laboratory. The
object is to make the Gary school, in the
words of Superintendent Wirt, “as much as
possible like a large family wherein the
younger children are learning consciously
and unconsciously from the older, and the
latter from contact with the younger children
are learning to assume responsibility and
take the initiative. Some one has said that
we send our boy to school, but his playmates,
not the school faculty, educate him. This is
true because in the conventional school the
faculty does not utilize the playmates as assistant
instructors.” This “helper” system
has proved to be one of the most valuable
features of the Gary schools.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the pupil, organization means a degree
of flexibility and individual instruction extraordinary
for a public school. Except in the
lowest grades, the pupils are classified by
subjects as well as by grades, so that practically
college methods obtain. Each pupil has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>his own schedule or program, just as the
college student has. The executive principal
corresponds to the college registrar in
supervising these individual records. The
pupil is promoted by subjects and not by
grades, and may be promoted or demoted at
any time by the supervisor of instruction,
acting with the teacher. Grades, therefore,
represent merely years of schooling and not
classes which are promoted as units. Each
regular class has a maximum register of
forty, but the class does not work as a unit,
any more than a college class of sophomores
works as a unit. Some are taking one group
of subjects, some another. The work is thus
done largely in small groups, or even as individuals.
The great wealth of equipment
and the economical use of time permit a large
amount of practically individual instruction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The students of each grade are classified
into three groups—rapid, normal, and slow
workers. The rapid workers can easily complete
the twelve years’ course in ten years.
They may then enter college at sixteen years
of age. The great majority of the Gary pupils
who go to college actually come from this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>rapid-working group. The normal workers
complete the course in twelve years, and the
slow workers in fourteen. Many of the slow
workers do not attempt to complete the
course, but specialize in the industrial departments.
This grouping contemplates the
recognition of differences in the mental endowments
and ambitions of children of the
same age, so that means are provided for the
shortening of school life for some children
and the lengthening of it for others. Every
child is, as far as possible, working along
with his equals, so that the bright child is not
held back and rendered listless by the presence
of slower members in the class, nor is the
slow child discouraged by the competition of
the brighter ones. Every pupil may go as
fast as he can, and may specialize on the
work which he can best do. The presence of a
great variety of activities makes it possible
for the children who falter on their intellectual
work to give more attention to the manual
or artistic or physical work in which they
may excel.</p>

<p class='c007'>A special investigation was made in 1914
into the regrading of the pupils of two ninth-grade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>algebra classes in the Emerson School.
The results of regrading the classes into
rapid and slow workers showed marked improvement
in the interest displayed in the
algebra work, especially on the part of the
slow workers. No failures were reported
among the rapid workers, and only three
among the slow workers, and these were due
to absence from class. The total class average
for the slow division was in three months
raised five per cent. In the Jefferson School,
which has been operated on the Gary plan
longer than any other school, fifty-two per
cent of the children are one or more years
<i>ahead</i> of their normal grades.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many features of the Gary plan afford extraordinary
opportunities for extra assistance
in study and work. The pupil may take extra
work in a subject during a proportion of his
play, auditorium, or shop hours. If he is a
member of the “X” school, he may get the
same lesson repeated for him the same day by
attending the parallel class in the “Y” school
held at a different hour. He may come to the
voluntary Saturday school and get extra
coaching from the teacher, and the vacation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>school provides additional opportunity to
make up back work. No home work is allowed,
except to a small extent in the high-school
grades. The long school day, and the
freedom which the teacher has to distribute
her time and to conduct supervised study,
obviate the necessity for carrying books
away from the school. Since the state law
does not authorize the schools to provide
free textbooks, these must be provided by the
pupil, or, as in the case of most of the Gary
classes, bought by the school and loaned cooperatively
to a number of classes. Since
home work is not permitted, the books may
be kept in the school and distributed to the
classes as they require them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The headquarters of the pupil in the school
are not in the classroom, as in other public
schools. It is the teacher and not the class
which is assigned to the room. The teacher
remains in the room and the pupils go to him
or her, moving about individually from classroom,
shop, laboratory, etc., according to the
printed schedule card which each pupil holds.
The child’s headquarters is the spacious lockers
which line the corridors in the basements.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Each child has a private locker for books,
papers, and wraps. Strictly speaking, the pupil
in the Gary school, except in the lowest
grades, has no “teacher,” except the “register
teacher.” The departmental system gives
him many teachers, but no teacher. This
system and the self-governing responsibility
for his own schedule is intended to cultivate
initiative and responsibility on the
part of the pupil. It brings him from an early
age into contact with different personalities,
gives him the benefit of expert teaching and
a variety of movement and exercise. The
introduction of these free college methods
into the common school is, in the light of
public-school practice, a daring experiment,
but the Gary school experience seems to show
that it is quite possible to give the younger
children a large measure of freedom and individuality
of treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the schedules of the pupils are arranged
with reference to the requirements of
the state course of instruction, specialization
not being permitted, of course, except in the
higher grades, or where some special weakness
causes repeated failure. Yet the Gary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>schools have about twenty per cent of special
students who do not intend to finish the
course and are specializing in some departments.
But since, owing to the individualization
of schedules, every pupil is in a sense a
“special student,” the presence of this large
number of students causes no administrative
confusion, nor are the special students—as
would be the case in many schools operated
on a uniform plan—marked off invidiously
from those who are following the more regular
course.</p>

<p class='c007'>The segregation of sexes which the visitor
finds in some of the Gary schools and courses
is not the result of any prejudice against
coeducation. (All the activities are open
equally to boys and girls alike, so that girls
are found in the printing-shop and in the
wood-working classes, etc.) It is due to the
effort to give each boy and girl what he or she
needs. The organization of many classes,
such as play, gymnasium, personal hygiene,
and the manual activities which do not appeal
to the girls, or the domestic science
which does not appeal to the boys, required
this unisexual classification, and sometimes it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>has been retained to avoid the break-up of
classes in related subjects.</p>

<p class='c007'>An example of this effort to provide for all
kinds of students in the Gary school is the
first-year college work which is offered to
students who wish to remain in the school for
post-graduate work. The Gary school endeavors
thus to overlap the college, just as it
has made the common school dovetail into
the high school, and the day school into the
evening school. When the Gary high-school
students have come up through the Gary
schools, it is hoped to be able to send students
from the local schools at the age of eighteen
so prepared that they may complete the ordinary
college course in two years.</p>

<p class='c007'>A word should be said about the interrelation
of this flexibility of schedule with the
“helper” system. The choice of what subjects
the pupil shall study is not as willful and
anarchical as it may seem. In the lower
grades the regular studies are, of course, prescribed.
English, arithmetic, history, and
geography must be studied by all, with the
attendant “application” and “auditorium”
work. All must have physical education,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>music and expression, and some form of manual
and scientific work. The courses in science,
industrial work, and music and expression,
below the high school, are taken in
alternation. Each occupies one third of the
school year. The individual choice of the
pupil comes in what science or what shop
work he or she will take. The beginning is
not by chance, but really the result of a natural
process of selection by the child. All the
early years are made a sort of unconscious
prevocational school in which the child tries
out his interests and powers. Things are
neither forced on him nor aimlessly selected.
The child in kindergarten or first three grades
moves about the halls and corridors. Since
the shops and studios and laboratories are
not segregated, but distributed over the
building, so that all seem equally significant,
the child has every opportunity to become
familiar with them. His curiosity is aroused,
and, unaided, he is tempted to peer in
through the glass doors and windows, and
wonder what the older children are doing.
When the child has reached the fourth grade,
he already has an idea of what activity interests
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>him, and what he would like to try.
Fourth- and fifth-grade children then go in as
helpers to the seventh-, eighth-, and ninth-grade
students in shops, studios, and laboratories.
If the child finds the work does not
interest him, he still has a chance to try some
other work, and thus gradually sifts out what
is likely to be valuable to him for a vocation
or avocation. If he has special skill, he may
specialize in the higher grades. Such a plan
seems to be admirably devised to bring out
whatever capacities there are in the pupils,
and to insure almost automatically their interest
in work which in many schools is mere
unintelligent drudgery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vocational guidance in such a system is
simple and effective. The “auditorium”
teacher, in charge of the presentation of material
relating to the shops and industries, is
able to give information as to the desirability
of the several trades and industries as occupations.
For example, the school plumber
may prepare with his students a plumbing
outfit for an ordinary dwelling or apartment,
and give a lesson on the way in which plumbing
should be cared for in the home. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>plumbing instructor may know much about
plumbing, but very little about presenting his
information to a large body of students. The
“auditorium” teacher would assume the
responsibility of supervising such auditorium
presentations in order that they might be
dramatically effective. The day that the
plumber and his students present the advantages
and disadvantages of plumbing as a
trade, the teacher of industries may announce
to the boys in “auditorium” period that for
the remainder of the week any boy may be
excused for a personal consultation with him
concerning the desirability of joining a class
in plumbing. Students are thus directed in
their shop assignments by this “auditorium”
teacher of industries. Vocational guidance is
thus made possible as far as it is probably
wise to undertake such guidance in the school
at present. Such a plan directs the mechanically
inclined among the children by enlisting
their interest and then their will. The “auditorium”
teachers for the other activities may
also act as advisers in the same way. Teacher
and pupil thus coöperate, not in any haphazard
fashion, but systematically, in studying the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>various activities with a view to their future
use as a vocation. Such an attitude not only
organizes and motivates the work, but gives
it seriousness and purpose. Every detail of
organization in the Gary school is devised to
make the pupil as well as the teacher an integral
part of the school life, not only in its
own meaning, but in its relation to the outside
world.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>VI<br /> <br /><span class='c020'>CURRICULUM: LEARNING BY DOING</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> Gary curriculum, in spite of its many
special features, is neither eccentric nor overcrowded.
It follows the regular course of
study laid down for Indiana schools by the
State Department of Public Instruction.
Students who follow the full course may be
ready to enter college at the age of sixteen.
The additional facilities of the Gary schools
are not gained at the expense, therefore, of
the ordinary course of education. They are
made possible through a more ingenious distribution
of time throughout a longer school
day, and by an integration and interrelation
of subjects which tend to vitalize them all.</p>

<p class='c007'>The regular studies in the lower grades are
conducted along the conventional lines, with
the addition of the “application” work which
has been described. The English work is
further vitalized through the employment
of special teachers for “expression,” who
alternate with the special teachers of music.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Expression” is a mixture of elocution and
dramatics. The aim of the instruction is
evidently to bring the pupils to read and
speak with more intelligence and appreciation
than is usually done. It is to give the
training which will bear fruit in increased
expressiveness in all the studies of the school,
in all writing and reciting, in “auditorium”
and “application” work. So far, owing to
the peculiar requirements of talent in the
teachers and on account of the lack of good
American elocutionary and dramatic tradition,
the enterprise can scarcely be called
more than a frank and important experiment.
For the Gary curriculum with its emphasis
on self-activity, such training in expressiveness
is essential, and it can be depended upon
to improve rapidly in quality as the children
and teachers catch the spirit of the schools
and get the practice of “auditorium” and
“application” work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The importance of the equable division of
time between regular studies and special activities
has already been discussed. An important
feature of the Gary teaching is the
avoidance of that excessive subdivision of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>subjects which has affected curriculum-making
in many schools. History and geography
are here uniformly taught together; language,
grammar, spelling, reading, and writing are
taught as much as possible together as English;
physiology is taught in connection with
zoölogy. Since the teacher is left much initiative
in the distribution of her time, she
may emphasize and correlate the different
studies as she finds necessary. All the English
branches are taught constantly in connection
with the other studies. The history
or physics class may begin with a spelling-lesson.
Compositions in science or history,
or the brochures issued by the science departments,
are supervised by the English
teacher. We have seen how the shop and
commercial instructors give special work in
practical English and mathematics. The
effort is constant in the Gary curriculum to
teach a subject, not as an isolated body of
subject-matter, but as knowledge which may
bear on any or all the other departments of
the school community.</p>

<p class='c007'>Studies are taught also with as much bearing
as possible on the social activities of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>larger city community. The subject-matter
in the history and geography classes is really
“The Sociological World we Live in,” and
textbooks, histories, atlases, globes, newspapers,
and magazines become the reference
sources and the materials for understanding
that world. The working-out of such principles
must, of course, be a matter of experimentation
by able teachers, and the work
cannot be described in any formal manner.
Illustrations of some of the successful methods
can, however, be given. The history room
in the Emerson School, for instance, is found
by the visitor to be almost smothered in
maps and charts, most of them made by the
children themselves, in their effort to “learn
by doing,” and to contribute their part to
the school community. A large Indiana ballot,
a chart of the State Senate, a diagram
of the state administration, a table showing
the evolution of American political parties,
with many war maps and pictures, covered
the walls. The place is a workshop rather
than a classroom, with broad tables for map-drawing,
and a fine spread of papers and
magazines. The ninth-grade Gary children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>are, in fact, conducting what some progressive
colleges have introduced as “laboratory
work in history.”</p>

<p>THE HISTORY ROOM AT THE EMERSON SCHOOL</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When the writer visited the school, the
town of Gary was waging a campaign for a
new water-front park. The history class had
for some weeks been using this public issue as
a text for their work. They had been studying
“The City: A Healthful Place in Which
to Live (with special reference to parks).”
Outlines had been worked up from reference
books in the school branch of the public library.
These were read to the class and discussed
by them. Such a course became almost
one in town-planning, one of the most
fascinating and significant of current social
interests, and one which packs into itself a
maximum of historical, sociological, and geographical
information. Such a course provided
an admirable motive for a review of
history from a practical local point of view
which all the intelligent pupils could appreciate.
The outline follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The class in ancient history, owing to a
belief on the part of the instructor that no
child should be allowed to leave school without
a background of modern affairs, devotes
one day a week to contemporary history. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>weekly digest of the ten most important
events is kept in the history notebook, arranged,
three for foreign events, three for
national events, and four for local. Reports
are prepared and read upon assigned magazine
articles, especially from the <i>Literary Digest</i>,
<i>Outlook</i>, and <i>Independent</i>. Everything
is thus done to get the clue of historical
study from the interesting events around the
pupils. History is studied as much as possible
backward, instead of forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1912-13 the classes in modern history
became interested in the past of the Balkan
nations, in order to understand the reason
for their alliance against the Turkish Empire.
A digression was, therefore, made to clear this
point, and to vitalize thereby the history of
the related European countries. The next
year a similar interest was kindled in Mexico
and our relations with the Spanish-American
republics. During the past year the history
instructor has found the study of the last
two centuries of western Europe to move
along without effort, owing to the interest
in the great war.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a study of history clearly obviates the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>necessity of any separate study of “civics.”
History and geography taught in this way become
part of one’s general information. Magazines
and newspapers are freely used. The
systematic reading of the best weeklies and
papers surely is an important training, in an
age of so much cheap and worthless reading-matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>One history class had been making a
comparison of Athenian with Gary education.
This is another illustration of that constant
effort to make the pupils realize the meaning
of what they are doing and what is around
them. The effort of the Gary education is
to make the child acquainted with the purposes
of his school. He is not taught as an
inferior who must take without question wisdom
from immensely superior teachers, but as
an equal and democratic citizen of his school
community, learning wherever and whenever
he can. The ancient history class had for its
motto: “To improve its members as American
citizens by a study of the experiences of
the ancient peoples.” It would be difficult to
imagine a more admirable reason for historical
study than this phrase, the natural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>expression of the Gary child who wrote the
constitution for the class organization. Such
“social introspection” is as rare an intellectual
quality as it is valuable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history classes in the lower grades
use sand-tables to reproduce the topography
of the localities which are being studied, or
to describe the progress of some battle or invasion.
One of the pupils in 1912 constructed
with his own hands in the wood-working
shops a miniature Roman temple about five
feet in length, the plans of which he had
worked out from the descriptions in the histories.
These classes often engage in debates,
and the written reports which are sufficiently
interesting are read in “auditorium,” and
often printed in the local newspapers. Bulletin
boards are placed in the hall for displaying
important clippings. The pupils bring
these, and classify them under the headings,—foreign
news, American news, state, city,
and county news, pictures and cartoons, and
items on the special topics that are being
studied. The history classes have charge of
a small historical museum in the corridors,
which contains a loan collection of Indian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>relics and of pottery from Central America.</p>

<p class='c007'>The teaching of science occupies a unique
place in the Gary schools. Just as the history
and geography are taught as clues to the social
and political world around the pupil, so
the science is used to acclimatize him to the
natural world. The theory is that children
should commence the study of the sciences
while their minds are still plastic and their
interest in natural phenomena keen. The persistent
questions which the child asks are
attempts to get an understanding of the
world he lives in. Unless these questions are
answered, his interest is apt to wane as he
grows older. And unless he acquires a familiarity
with nature that is accompanied by
true scientific information, he is apt to get
only a satisfied feeling of knowledge without
any true appreciation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Science in the Gary schools, consequently,
goes beyond the simple nature-study taught
now in most elementary schools. The child
has experience with the laboratory at an
early age. The smaller children from the
third, fourth, fifth, or sixth grades go into
the chemistry, physics, botany, and zoölogy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>laboratories as “helpers” or “observers” to
the work of the high-school classes. On the
theory that “children are natural scientists”
they are allowed contact with apparatus and
materials. It is said, in fact, that experience
shows the smaller children to be as careful
as the older, and actually to cause less breakage
and damage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The science classes in the lower grades
are taught neither in formal recitation nor
in formal laboratory work, but in a combination
which the instructors describe as “experience
meetings.” Pupils and teacher meet
on common ground to exchange ideas about
their experiences in dealing with natural
phenomena. The outside world is treated as
a great laboratory, and these “experience
meetings” are used to interpret the children’s
experiences in terms of scientific principles.
There are demonstrations by the children,
assisted by the teacher; a little individual
laboratory work; and considerable vocal reading
from textbooks and scientific story-books.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gary science instructors believe that
much time and money have been wasted
in the teaching of science in high schools,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>owing to the elaborate methods which have
treated the students as if the purpose was
to make professional scientists of them all.
Children, it is believed in Gary, cannot resort
to the detailed research methods of scientists,
but must have quick answers and
quick results. There is a waste of energy in
trying to duplicate in the laboratory the fundamental
experiences of life which the children
are constantly seeing outside in the
great laboratory of nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The care of the flowers and plants and
gardens, the care of the animals in the zoo,
and the study of their habits offer endless
concrete material for building up the theoretical
side of botany and zoölogy. The pupils
are trained to observe and to write down
what they see. One class in zoölogy last year
made an illustrated booklet descriptive of
the school zoo. The text was written by the
pupils, the photographs prepared by them,
and then the booklet was tastefully printed
in the school printing-shop by the pupils
themselves. The result was a charming brochure,
in which not only the pupils themselves,
but the whole school could take pride
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>and pleasure. Such scientific study becomes
an intimate and vital part of the entire school
life.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the physics classes, the lighting, heating,
and ventilating systems of the school
afford a practical textbook. In the Jefferson
School, where the industrial shop is built
around the boiler-room, the heating plant
becomes an integral part of the shop. The
physics classes study the climate and the
weather. They study particularly the principles
of the machines used in the different
shops. Each shop may thus act as an extension
of the physics laboratory. Classes of even
the smaller children are sent to take apart
machines like the bicycle, cream-separator,
lawn-mower, and explain the construction.
The automobile and motor-cycle provide
many practical lessons. An old automobile
which needs tinkering up is considered in the
Gary school to be almost a physics laboratory
in itself. The writer witnessed a physics
class of twelve-year-old girls who, with their
nine-year-old “helpers,” were studying the
motor-cycle. With that disregard for boundaries
which characterizes all Gary education,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>the hour began with a spelling-lesson. The
names of the parts and processes of the machine
were rehearsed orally and then written.
After the words were learned, the parts of the
machine were explained by the instructor
while the class spelled the words over again.
Their memory of certain physical principles,
such as vaporization, evaporation, were
called again into play. Then the instructor
set the motor-cycle going, the girls again
describing its action. When this had been
thoroughly gone over, the class copied from
the blackboard sentences describing the
processes and parts, but omitting certain
crucial words which the pupil had to supply.
The intense vivacity and interest of the little
group, the intelligence with which these
small children grasped the principles involved,
made the lesson seem a model of expert
teaching. It was an excellent illustration
of the way concrete processes may be used to
build up scientific knowledge. It is interesting
to notice that no distinction is made between
boys and girls in their science work.</p>

<p class='c007'>This lively interest in scientific processes
may have unexpected results. The story is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>told of a high-school boy who, while the
board of education was discussing means of
fire-prevention, made an investigation of
methods and processes which was so excellent
that it was forthwith adopted by the
board.</p>

<p class='c007'>This incident is typical of the way in which
the scientific work in the schools may correlate
with the wider social community. Just
as the history classes may bring the pupil
into touch with the political life outside the
school, so the physics and chemistry class
may connect him with the industry of the
community and with those public services
into which scientific processes enter. A boy,
for example, brings to the chemistry class a
bag of low-grade iron ore which he has found
in the vicinity. The class, under the direction
of the teacher, constructs a simple electric
furnace and reduces the ore. This experiment
is then used as the basis for a study of
the great steel industry upon which the city
of Gary is founded.</p>

<p class='c007'>A part of the chemistry work makes a
direct contribution to the city. Gary has the
good fortune, or the good sense, to have as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>chemistry teacher in the Emerson School
the man who acts as municipal chemist for
the city. As a result, the school laboratory
becomes an extension of the municipal laboratory.
The high-school chemistry pupils
assist the chemist just as the smaller children
assist them. With the chemist-instructor
the pupils test the city water and the
various milk supplies. Under the sanitary
inspector they visit, as part of their “application”
work, dairies, factories, bakeries,
food-stores. Last year the class issued a
“Milk Bulletin,” containing general information,
with reports of their tests. The various
articles were recorded as part of the English
composition work, and the bulletin was
printed by the pupils in the school printing-shop.
In quality these bulletins seemed
scarcely inferior to what an agricultural
school might issue. On their inspection
rounds, the class takes samples of sugars
and candies from the various shops of the
town, and tests them in the laboratory for
purity and for the use of harmless coloring
matter. Another class experiments with the
soft drinks sold in the town, testing their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>composition, and studying physiological
effects. The children are practically deputy
food-inspectors, and make their reports on
the official blanks. It is said that the result
of this sort of inspection is that in a prosecution
for violation of the pure-food laws in
Gary a case has never been lost.</p>

<p class='c007'>The children test also the materials supplied
to the schools, the coal, cement, etc.,
to see if they come up to the specifications.
They are not only using the things around
them for practical textbooks, but they are
able to turn their knowledge immediately
into work which is immensely beneficial, not
only to themselves, but to the whole community.
The value of enlisting pupils in this
inspection work, of training them to observe
and criticize and test the physical conditions
under which they live, is incalculable. For
even a small proportion of children to get
this scientific-deputy-inspector habit, and to
get used to thinking in terms of qualitative
and quantitative tests, would evidently have
some effect upon political and social conditions.
Such scientific training makes science
an integral part of life, not only a knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>of how natural forces and materials behave,
but also a command of technical resources
in making them behave in desirable ways.
The pupils in such a school, from their
earliest years, get a correct appreciation of
the value of science in ameliorating conditions
and in improving the healthfulness and
security of the community in which they live.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gary curriculum seems to represent
a determined effort to break down the distinction
between the “utilitarian” and the
“cultural.” All the subjects are taught, as
far as possible, in concrete ways which shall
draw upon familiar experience and teach the
child by making him do something. That
something is made, as far as possible, an
activity which will enhance the life of the
school community, or contribute to the social
community. These activities are “utilitarian,”
but they are at the same time profoundly
educative. Principles are never lost
sight of in practice. The artistic and academic
work take equal rank with the manual.
Both “cultural” and “utilitarian” are,
in fact, subjected to the “<i>social</i>.” This is
the key note of the Gary education.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>VII<br /> <br /><span class='c020'>DISCIPLINE: THE NATURAL SCHOOL</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> problems of discipline in a Gary
school are essentially different from those of
public schools run on the usual semi-military
plan. The large degree of coöperation
between teachers and pupils and between
pupils, the emphasis on laboratory, shop,
and “application” work, where freedom of
movement and conversation is essential,
produces a more natural atmosphere, and a
certain amount of genuine if unconscious
self-government. The children in the Gary
schools are generally conscious of the unique
features of their school; they understand
what the school is trying to do. This sense,
and their pride in its fame, cultivate an admirable
school spirit denied to those schools
which are operated on conventional lines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The organization of the Gary school permits
the reduction of formal discipline to a
minimum. It allows the teachers to dispense
with disciplinary rules against whispering,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>with formal punishments, with formal marks
or demerits for conduct. The frequent change
of activity, with opportunities for exercise
throughout the day, prevents the children
from becoming nervously overwrought. They
thus escape irritability and aimless boisterousness
when left to themselves. The “application”
and shop work compel attention,
so that the child is kept busy and interested,
and the mischievousness that arises from
idleness or distracted attention is avoided.
As Professor Dewey says, “Trained in doing
things, the child will be able to keep at work
and to think of the other people around him
when he is not under restraining supervision.”
When the teacher’s rôle changes from preceptor
to that of helper, it is obvious that what
is needed in the classroom is not so much
perfect quiet and military order as freedom of
expression and spontaneity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Visitors to the Gary schools bear witness
to the peculiarly beneficial effects of this
absence of formal discipline. The free and
individual way in which the children move
about to their tasks and the spontaneous
way in which they talk to visitors make a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>marked impression. In classroom or laboratory
or shop, it is usual to find about as much
whispering as in a concert audience, with the
same motives, freed of “rules of order,” for
quiet. A natural atmosphere of orderly and
tolerant conduct seems to be formed in such
a school.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writer witnessed an interesting study
in spontaneous discipline in one of the Saturday
voluntary classes at the Froebel School.
The wood-working shop was filled with little
boys who were fussing over the scraps left by
the week’s work and trying to make toys and
knick-knacks out of them. The teacher was
in the room, but was exercising no control
over the children. Yet each little boy worked
on his own little job as indefatigably as if he
were under a drill-master. If any of them
became weary and was moved to interfere
with another small worker, he was apt to be
brushed off as if he were an irritating fly.
The theory at the back of such freedom is that
rules in the school tempt to infraction, and
school discipline is, as a result, largely an
attempt to solve problems which the rules
directly manufacture. Some visitors, appalled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>by the freedom of the Gary schools, look
about for signs of depredation. But they do
not seem to find any. The visitor gets the
impression that these schools have acquired
a “public sense.” The schools are the children’s
own institution, and are public in the
same broad sense that streets and parks are
public. The tone is of a glorified democratic
club, where members are availing themselves
of privileges which they know are
theirs. One expects children, unless they are
challenged to inventive wickedness, no more
to spoil their school than a lawyer is likely
to deface the panels of his club. The children
seem in such a school unaffectedly to
own it, and to use it as a mechanic uses his
workshop or an artist his studio. The halls
in the Gary school become really school
streets. Benches are built by the pupils
along the walls, where children are seen informally
studying together. Or one comes
upon a table where a boy is drawing a map,
having been excused from recitation, on the
theory that it is not necessary for every
child to be exposed to every exercise of the
class when he might do something more important
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>outside. The children come with
their parents to night school and play and
run about the broad halls quite unwatched.
The visitor gets the idea that children come
to such a school, not because education is
compulsory or because their parents send
them there to get rid of them, but because
what is done there is so interesting that they
will not stay away. The equipment, used so
freely, makes the school a substitute for the
defects, not only of the poorer homes, but
of the well-to-do also, in supplying activities
for children.</p>

<p class='c007'>One might say that only in a free and
varied school like this was such a thing as
effective discipline possible. When school
activities are as attractive as they are in the
Gary school, deprivation means a distinct
punishment. There is ready at hand an instrument
for inculcating reason into the refractory
which is as powerful as the stoutest
disciplinarian could wish. The ordinary
school has its difficulties with discipline
largely because it tries to keep up a military
system of conduct without any means, now
that corporal punishment is generally abolished,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>of punishing infractions. Marks prove
ineffective, “keeping in” punishes the keeper
as well as the kept, and being sent home is
too often a pleasure. But in the Gary school,
“being sent home” would mean being sent
to a place infinitely less interesting, and being
deprived of school play or any special activity
would mean a real hardship. The free
and spontaneous discipline of the Gary school
does not mean that there is no discipline at
all. Unruly cases are sometimes punished severely
by the executive principal. But there
is little talk about “mischievous and unruly
boys.” Children who, in spite of everything,
are “not adapted to our kind of a school,”
may go to the school farm. This, however, is
not a reform school for juvenile delinquents.
Delicate children may be sent there for a
vacation or classes go for a holiday. The
farm contains a hundred acres, with a model
dairy, good orchards, and substantial farm
buildings. A graduate from one of the state
universities is in charge, and is working to
bring the farm up to a high pitch of cultivation
and production. One group of boys who
were there for a while, some of whom had come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>from homes surrounded by unwholesome
conditions, others of whom wished to try
farming for a livelihood, built themselves
living quarters and a clubroom. They were
provided with a teacher, and school work
went on with the farm work. The boys received
fifteen cents an hour for their work,
and earned enough to pay their board and
make something besides. These boys finally
drifted back to the Emerson School or to
work in the factories. But the farm remains
as a valuable adjunct to the schools. Efforts
are being made to make it a source of income
and an object lesson to farmers in the
vicinity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Freedom of discipline is obtained in the
Gary schools without the methods of “self-government”
and “honor systems” which
prevail elsewhere. Where the teachers retain
all authority, such schemes can be little more
than a humiliating pretense. For a time
an elaborate self-government plan was tried
in the Emerson School under the name of
“Boyville,” with a sort of parody of municipal
functions. But it seems to have been
too unreal to last. It has been superseded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>a “students’ council,” elected by the pupils
of the upper grades, and exercising control
over athletics, social, and other student affairs.
This students’ council has executive charge
of the “auditorium” periods, for which it
elects a presiding officer and secretary, alternately
a boy and a girl, every month. The
elections for councilors are conducted in
regular form, with ballots printed by the pupils
in the school printing-shop. Booths are
erected, judges appointed, and the election
carried through, after a campaign, in which
the parties meet, nominate a boy and girl for
each office, and appoint a campaign manager
who arranges a program for the campaign.
The candidates make speeches, giving their
views and the arguments for their policies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like everything in the Gary schools, this
political practice is put into effect on a
broader scale. During a recent campaign the
students’ council in the Emerson School arranged
a public meeting at which prominent
men of the city appeared and argued
for their respective parties. The meeting was
entirely organized and managed by the pupils.
Such practical application seems far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>more real and instructive than the usual play
at self-government.</p>

<p class='c007'>Student organization in the Gary schools
grows out of real work. Athletic teams and
sports of various kinds are connected directly
with the gymnasium work and organized
play. Glee clubs and orchestras grow
out of the music work. A monthly paper is
conducted by the high-school pupils as part
of their English work, and printed by them
in the school printing-shop. There are,
strictly speaking, no “extra-curricular activities”
in the Gary schools. The curriculum
deliberately provides for all wholesome activities,
and the student interests grow out
of it. Problems of “fraternities” and of the
control of school athletics, which confront so
many schools, are thus avoided. The students
do not get into the habit of thinking of
their clubs and teams as something outside
of the school community life.</p>

<p class='c007'>An example of how spontaneous organization
may spring up is that of the boys’ ninth-grade
English class last year in the Emerson
School, which formed itself into the Emerson
Improvement Association. It tries to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>suggest civic improvements for the school
community, and the speaking and writing
necessary to the conducting of the affairs
of the organization provide the basis for the
English work.</p>

<p>DRAWING FROM A MODEL AT THE EMERSON SCHOOL<br />Notice frieze on wall designed and painted by the children themselves</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This illustrates the way that effort is made
to take advantage of all the spontaneity and
initiative which pupils display in organization.
The moral effects of this active form of
education are clearly great. Professor Dewey
thinks it is a mistake to consider that an
interesting and free school “makes things
too easy for the child.” In the ideal school
the interests and needs of the child are identical.
It is a mistake, he says, to think that
interesting things are necessarily easy. They
may be hard, but the interest overcomes the
difficulty, and it is in the overcoming that the
moral value lies. Irksome tasks may be valuable,
but it is not in their irksomeness that
their value lies. Work that appeals to pupils
as worth while, that holds out the promise
of resulting in something to their own or the
school’s interests, involves just as much persistence
and concentration as work given by
the sternest advocate of disciplinary drill.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Most of the visitors to the Gary schools
bear witness to the excellent tone of the pupils,
“the free and natural way,” to quote
one authoritative teacher, “in which pupils
govern themselves without the rigorous discipline
found in other systems.” Dr. Harlan
Updegraff, of the Federal Bureau of Education,
says, “The pupils of the Gary schools
seem to display greater self-control, more
self-respect, and more thoughtful consideration
for others than the pupils of the same
age in most of the better school systems of
to-day. I am inclined to think that it comes
largely from their games and play, but a part
of it is due to the organization of the school,
and to the practices that have evolved in
its administration. No child in Gary has a
single teacher who is the object of his hero-worship,
upon whom he tends to become
more or less dependent, or his arch-enemy
whom he detests with a growing hatred.
The Gary pupil has several teachers, each of
whom affects him in a different way. He
becomes more conscious of his individuality
in this way, and learns to determine for himself
what he should do and become. Under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>such a system the influence of fellow pupils
becomes relatively stronger than in the ordinary
school. It is, therefore, highly important
that care be taken to further the development
of right ideals in the student body.
Organized play has its great value here. Self-control,
coöperation, courage, self-respect,
consideration for others, and a sense of justice
have been developed in the Gary youth
to a noticeable degree, largely, it seems to
me, through the spirit that prevails in consequence
of the administration of the physical
training department. Pupils who love their
school better than the streets, who have a
good physical tone through their play and
physical exercises, and who have good self-control
and independence of thought, must
naturally have a more favorable attitude
toward school work.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a school will evidently train character
as a by-product. Self-activity, self or
coöperative instruction, freedom of movement,
<i>camaraderie</i> with teachers, interesting
and varied work, study, and play, a sense of
what the school is doing, social introspection,—all
combine to give an admirable moral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>training and to produce those desirable intellectual
and moral qualities that the world
most needs to-day. Not obedience but self-reliance
does such a school cultivate.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>VIII<br /> <br /><span class='c020'>CRITICISMS AND EVALUATIONS</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> criticisms directed against the Gary
schools by superintendents and teachers are
criticisms rather of the whole educational
philosophy behind the institution than objections
to the detailed working-out of the
philosophy. Those who follow Professor
Dewey’s philosophy find in the Gary schools—as
Professor Dewey does himself—the
most complete and admirable application
yet attempted, a synthesis of the best aspects
of the progressive “schools of to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Concrete criticisms almost all concern the
alleged additional burdens laid upon the public,
the teacher, and the pupil. As far as the
public goes, the fact has been brought out
that the Gary school is actually a cheaper
kind of a school than is the ordinary public
school, even when run in the most economical
and scientific manner. The charge that the
Gary schools are aided by private corporation
enterprise has already been discussed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>The facts are, of course, that the schools are
all supported in the usual way, by local and
state appropriations. The city of Gary is not
overtaxed to support its schools, neither does
the United States Steel Corporation pay
more than its proportionate share of the local
taxes. Nor is there any truth in the impression
that the operation of the Gary plan is
confined to the two larger school plants of
the city. Although these two plants accommodate
three quarters of the children of the
city, the Gary plan is in operation in all the
schools. In the two larger schools, Emerson
and Froebel, the academic work extends
from the kindergarten through all twelve
grades. In the other schools there are no
high-school students. Four of the other
schools have eight grades, one has six, one is
only for children in the kindergarten and first
two grades. These schools have no high-school
department because they are too
small and the schools with high-school departments
are easily accessible. All the
schools have real shopwork, though in not
all of them is the apprentice-repair feature
possible. All the schools have play and recreation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>facilities. The smaller schools lack
swimming-pools, but the children use the
well-equipped Y.M.C.A. All the schools
have “auditorium,” science, music, and expression
work. All the schools either contain
a branch of the public library or else use the
main building near by. All the schools have
an eight-hour day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The charge that the Gary schools are too
costly for imitation cannot be sustained.
We have seen the ingenious efforts of the
various features of the Gary plans to reduce
costs, and there is a wealth of figures to
show in detail the greater economy of the
Gary plan. Superintendent Wirt has made
an estimate that for an outlay of $6,000,000,
“part-time” could be wholly abolished in
the New York City public schools by an
adoption of the Gary plan. The requisition
of the board of superintendents in 1914 was
for an appropriation of $40,000,000, simply
for new buildings, which would require large
sums for operation and maintenance and
lack the equipments of the Gary plan. By
the multiple use of facilities, Superintendent
Wirt has shown that the number of school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>plants in New York could actually be reduced
and yet the part-time of 132,000 children
abolished. At the same time that this
was done, the school day would actually be
increased and the facilities more than doubled.
A comparison between the <i>per-capita</i>
costs of instruction in the Gary and New
York City schools, figured in average daily
attendance for 1913-14, has been made by
Mrs. Alice Barrows-Fernandez. (The Jefferson
School in Gary is used for the comparison
because it is more like the elementary
schools in New York than any other school
in Gary.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“In other words,” says Mrs. Barrows-Fernandez
in her report, “in the Froebel
School, which is typical of the average school
because only twelve per cent of its pupils are
in high school, twelve years in elementary
school and high school costs the city for one
pupil twelve times $32.85, or $394.20. In New
York, eight years in elementary school costs
the city for one student eight times $40.24,
or $329.92, and four years in high school
costs four times $104.74, or $418.96; or for
the twelve years, $748.88. In Gary for the
$394.20, a student could also get more vocational
training than is given in a separate
trade school. The New York boy would get
none of this in the elementary school. Even
if we make allowances for the fact that the
average salary of teachers in elementary
schools and high schools in New York City
is one third higher than in Gary, it is obvious
that the balance of economy is immensely
in favor of Gary as against a large typical
city school system operated on the conventional
lines.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems established that the Gary plan
imposes no burdens upon the public, either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>in Gary or in the communities who imitate
the plan, but rather provides increased facilities
at reduced cost, besides immense facilities
for adults. As for the burden upon the
teacher, much has been said to the effect
that the Gary plan is unpopular among
teachers because of the extra work it entails.
In connection with this criticism, it must
be remembered that the Gary plan postulates
an educational philosophy different
from that of the ordinary public schools.
Teachers trained in schools managed with
rigid administrative and disciplinary methods
naturally find adjustment difficult in a system
which repeatedly calls upon them for
initiative, alters their relations to their pupils,
and requires a more practical attitude
of “application” toward the subject-matter
of instruction. Experience seems to show
that many teachers who at first found this
adjustment burdensome have later come to
prefer the Gary plan. One teacher with a
fine scholastic training, who had taught for
many years under the traditional form of
organization, is quoted by Dean Burris as
saying, “I did not like it when I came here a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>year ago, but I begin to like it and see what
it is all about, so I am going to stay.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This attitude would seem to be typical
of the intelligent teacher who comes to appreciate
what it is all about and the valuable
educational advantages which the system
provides for the teacher herself. And although
the problem of securing teachers
has been somewhat difficult in Gary, owing
to the newness of the town, the large factory
population, and the relative absence of
organized social life, most visitors are impressed
by the unusual personal caliber of the
head teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is difficult to see where the Gary plan
involves extra burdens for teachers. The
teaching period is only four hours a day,
with an hour for “auditorium” and an hour
for “application.” This is certainly no more
exacting than the five-hour teaching day of
the ordinary teacher. All “home work” and
“paper work,” moreover, is supposed to be
done by the Gary teacher during school
hours, so that her school day is over when the
bell rings. This makes her real school day
actually shorter than that of the teacher in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>the ordinary school, whose afternoons and
evenings must often be spent in correcting
papers, etc. The Gary teacher is supposed
to have leisure and to behave in school and
out of school as a good citizen actively interested
in the community welfare. The
Saturday school work, for which the teachers
are called upon in turn, is paid for at a
rate of one dollar an hour. The care and
work involved in the “register-teacher” plan
is certainly offset by its valuable educational
value for the teacher herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be clear that the various features
of the Gary plan tend to relieve the teacher
of burdens and particularly of nervous strain.
The teaching of special subjects by special
teachers relieves the grade teacher of the
obligation of teaching, under the exacting
direction of supervisors, subjects like music
and drawing with which she may be little
acquainted. The departmentalizing of subjects
down through the lower grades gives
a breadth to the teachers’ work, and enables
them to concentrate on the subjects which
interest them, rather than diffuse their attention
among many. The absence of uniform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>standards, the absence of formal term
examinations for which a whole class must be
prepared, the promotion of children by subjects
rather than whole classes, as well as the
division of grades according to rate of progress,—all
this makes for a great saving in
the teacher’s nervous energy. She does not
have the strain of passing her whole class
in every subject, of finishing her course on
schedule time, of cramming for examinations.
She has some freedom in the division of her
time and a voice in the making of the course
and curriculum. The less experienced teacher
has in her classroom the assistance and advice
of the senior teacher, as well as of the head
teacher of her subjects in the head school.
Teachers are not rivals, but colleagues as in
a college faculty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The freer methods of discipline are much
to the teacher’s advantage. When the ideal
is no longer to keep the classroom in a rigid
military silence, a large part of the teacher’s
energy may go into teaching which formerly
went into the maintenance of discipline.
Where “interest” and “application”
and “learning by doing” are the keynotes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>and where every one—teacher and pupil
alike—is at some time in the course both
teaching some one and learning from some
one, the teacher is no longer interested in
“making the child obey,” or “commanding
his respect.” No official gulf is set between
teachers and pupils. It is discipline that
wears out most teachers,—and children too,—and
a greater flexibility makes for the
lessening of nervous strain on both.</p>

<p class='c007'>The custom of “helpers and observers,”
the emphasis on discussion rather than formal
recitation, even take a certain amount
of actual teaching out of the hands of the
teachers. The teacher, as in the Montessori
method, becomes the guide and mentor rather
than direct preceptor. She is no longer so
much concerned with predigesting subject-matter
and presenting it in logical form to
the pupil, only to draw it from him again in
recitation and written examination. She is
rather concerned with directing the large
amount of practical work which the Gary
child does in every course, and in devising
methods of “application,” or in turning the
work into practical value for the school community.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Those classes where the “helper
and observer” system obtains are, to a large
degree, self-instructing. The older child tells
the younger what he is doing in shop or laboratory,
etc., and when the younger child
comes to take up the work, he is already
familiar with materials and apparatus and the
significance of the course. Raw new classes
thus do not have to be constantly broken in
by the teacher. This means a very large saving
of labor for the teacher, while it makes
for the more thorough understanding on the
part of the pupil. In the physical education
work and in the organized play, the older pupils
are enlisted as assistants to the teachers.
Superintendent Wirt’s new plans involve the
employment throughout the different departments
as teachers’ assistants of a class
of older pupils, selected for their interest
and ability. Such work not only gives the
student the best possible training for developing
leadership, initiative, and the ability
to assume responsibility, but it also relieves
the teachers and makes possible many small
classes without extra teachers and without
extra rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>From the teachers’ point of view, then,
the numerous ways in which the Gary plan
relieves the nervous strain and actual responsibility
of teaching, and removes the pressure
of outside work, more than compensate
for the slightly longer actual time during
which the teacher must be in the school
plant. And since this longer time means
increased salary, it is clear that the teacher
under the Gary plan is the gainer in every
direction.</p>

<p class='c007'>The criticisms of the Gary plan on the
ground that the long school day and varied
curriculum overload the pupil can scarcely
be sustained in view of the fact that the
“school day” is not merely a lengthening of
the ordinary public school day, but an absorbing,
in healthful activities of play, exercise
and manual work, of time which would
otherwise be spent in demoralizing street
and alley or in idleness at home. We have
seen that this additional activity is not
gained at the expense of the academic
studies, but comes from giving the children
interesting things to do in the surplus hours
in which they are usually left to take care of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>themselves. The freedom of the Gary schools,
and the constant passing back and forth between
school and home, church, etc., does
not seem to make for truancy. The percentage
of attendance in November, 1914, was
for boys 92.9, for girls, 91.6,—a remarkable
record when it is considered that boy truancy
in most city schools is much the greater.
For the year 1913-14 the percentage of attendance
was for boys 89.5, for girls, 89.2.</p>

<p class='c007'>The criticism of the Gary school on the
ground that the shopwork either involves
the risk of exploiting the pupil, or else introduces
him to manual activity at too early an
age, ignores the fact that the manual work
is really unspecialized and is introduced so
gradually into the child’s life that it is
scarcely felt as work. “Play” and “work”
are merged in “interesting activity,” and
almost unconsciously the child finds himself
absorbed in work which may be his vocation
later on. Whether it is to be his vocation or
not, the Gary school believes that such work
is a good thing in the education of all children.
Many educators believe that the novel
form of shopwork in the Gary school offers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>a solution for the problems of industrial
training. There is great risk, in schools
where shopwork is introduced apart from the
academic work, as in special technical high
schools, of an undemocratic and invidious
distinction between the manual worker and
the brain worker. In plans of organization,
such as the Ettinger plan in New York City,
with a preliminary course of “prevocational
training,” in which the prospective industrial
pupil in the seventh and eighth grades discovers
by hasty experimentation which trade
his aptitudes fit him to pursue, there is great
danger that the vocational work will be left
unassimilated to the rest of the school work
and the child trained into a narrow specialist.
Such “vocational training” deserves all the
criticism that has been directed against it by
the opponents of a too “utilitarian” education.
The Gary type of vocational training
keeps the industrial work constantly in touch
with the other activities, and makes it a
really “cultural” branch of the school community
work. And because the children lay
their foundations of skill and interest so
early and work at real work under real workmen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>their training from a practical point of
view is as good as, if not better than, the
special trade school is likely to give them.
More shops are actually supported in the
Gary school than even the most elaborate
special trade school can afford to provide.
The correlation of day courses with evening
continuation courses, the great attention to
science, the emphasis on the social and communal
bearing of all activities,—all this
means a higher type of vocational training
than has been worked out generally in the
public school. If he is intelligent, he will be
better qualified for skilled work than the
more narrowly trained worker. “This is the
age,” says Superintendent Wirt, “of the
engineer, of machinery, and of big business.
The school business enterprises offer a type
of industrial and commercial education facilities
... adapted to modern industry and
business. There are big business problems
and machinery problems in the school.”
These problems evolved in the life of a school
community give an education, he holds,
superior to what can be given even in schools
narrowly devoted to shop-training. And it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>can give the training in small groups or even
to individuals, where the special school has
to give instruction in large classes to make it
pay at all. As Mrs. Barrows-Fernandez puts
it, “If you believe that vocational education
is confined to specific training for a trade,
and that this must be carried on in a separate
trade school, and that general education has
no relation to it except as it may add a fringe
of culture, then you will think that there is
no vocational education in Gary. But, on
the other hand, if you belong to the group
that believes that what children under sixteen
need in the way of vocational work is
not specialized trade training on top of an
inadequate elementary-school education, but
fundamental industrial training closely related
to the science and academic work, and
made real and natural because it is one of the
many activities of the whole school,—then
you will come away from Gary feeling that
the vocational work there represents the
soundest point of view and the best practical
accomplishment in vocational work for children
under sixteen that can be found anywhere
in the country.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>In New York City, where an extended
experimentation is being carried on with the
Gary plan, considerable controversy is said
to have arisen over the provision of the Gary
scheme which permits outside institutions,
including churches, to coöperate with the
school and take children for a few hours a
week for any special work, amusement, or
instruction which the schools cannot give.
The fear was expressed there that this provision
would mean the entering wedge of
religion into the public school.</p>

<p class='c007'>As outlined by Mr. Wirt, however, the
Gary plan holds no brief for religious instruction.
It has no concern with any church
activity as such. What it tries to do is to
coördinate the community child-welfare agencies
with the school. The lengthening of
the school day absorbs an hour which would
otherwise be spent by the city child in the
street, or at home, church, or settlement.
All the Gary school does is to organize and
systematize this hour. It may be spent by
the child either in play or auditorium at the
school, or in any outside activity which provides
wholesome activities for children. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>object is to coördinate the community opportunities
so that they may function regularly
and vitally instead of spasmodically as at
present. The school gives to all the agencies
which pretend to be interested in the child’s
welfare a chance to spend themselves effectively.
It brings up to the level of public
discussion, for the first time, the question
what sort of home, church, and neighborhood
activities are good for children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Into this scheme the church enters merely
as a community institution. As long as any
considerable number of the parents of the
children in a school believe that religious
instruction is valuable, no public school
which attempts to be really public can refuse
to release children for this purpose, just as it
releases them for playgrounds, settlements,
libraries, home music, or other instruction.
This outside time is not taken from study.
Nor are the children turned out into the
streets to be taken care of by the churches
and other institutions. No child is excused
unless the parents make formal application.
If the parents do not do this, the child stays
at the school for the full seven or eight hours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>of work, study, and play. The burden of
responsibility rests entirely upon the parents
and the churches. The teachers have nothing
to do with the matter, either in segregating
the children or seeing where they go. There
seems to be little fear that the practice will
not conform to the theory. Mr. Wirt tells
us that his work-study-and-play school had
been functioning for twelve years in Bluffton
and Gary before any religious organization
took advantage of this provision. The idea
that the opportunity would unduly increase
religious influence in the schools seems to be
groundless. In the Jefferson School in Gary,
which has been longest in operation under
the Wirt plan, and where the fullest efforts
have been made by all the sects and religions
of the town to provide this supplementary
instruction, scarcely half the children in the
spring of 1915 were going out to any sort of
religious training whatever. And in one of
the Wirt schools in New York, where unusual
efforts have been made by some of the
churches to meet the new plan, not even half
of the children are released for this purpose.
In another Wirt school in New York, none
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>of the children are released, because there
is no demand for it on the part of the parents.</p>

<p class='c007'>What the Gary plan seems to do is not to
bring religion into the schools, but for the
first time to take it out of the schools. The
relations now between church and school are
hidden. The Gary plan brings them out into
the open. The establishment of a fair, free,
and open relation between the school and
all other community institutions is of utmost
importance. No institution which has anything
valuable to offer the child will lose by
such a relation. No outside power can dominate
or even partially control a public school
which has established it.</p>

<p class='c031'><i>We may sum up the Gary school, then, as
primarily a school community for children of
all ages between nursery and college, providing
wholesome activities under a fourfold division
of work, study, play, and expression. It aims
to provide the best possible environment for the
growing child throughout the course of a full
eight-hour day. The school community, replacing
the old-time education of household and</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span><i>school, aims to be as self-sustaining as possible,
all activities contributing to the welfare of the
school community life. By the multiple use of
school facilities, on the plan of public-service
principles, such a school may be provided at
no more expense than that of the ordinary public
school. The economics effected by this multiple
use enable the Gary school to provide
recreational and educational facilities for adults
as well as children all the year round, as well as
to pay better salaries to teachers, and completely
solve “part-time problems.” It makes the
school the cultural center of a community with
parks, libraries, and museums functioning as
contributory to the school, as well as all other
activities which provide wholesome interests for
children. It makes the school, for the first time,
a genuine “social center,” and a genuinely
“public school” in a comprehensive sense
scarcely realized hitherto.</i></p>

<p class='c032'>No better evaluation of the Gary plan
has been made than that by William Paxton
Burris, Dean of the College for Teachers,
University of Cincinnati, in the <i>Bulletin</i> of
the United States Bureau of Education, 1914,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>no. 18. In his opinion the school system at
Gary provides:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. For the better use of school-buildings
day and evening, including Saturdays, the
year round, making it possible to save large
sums of money expended for this purpose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This multiple use of school plants, which
secures greatly increased facilities at greatly
reduced cost, while it permits the giving of
full-time instruction to all the children of
even the congested school districts, is the aspect
which has appealed most generally to
educators outside of Gary. For administrators
confronted with problems of part-time,
it makes an examination of the Wirt plan
almost essential. No educationist can afford
to ignore a plan which, in mere details of mechanical
administration, provides not only a
full-time program, but actually a longer
school day, for all the children in the city
school—something hitherto considered impossible
in the larger school systems. The
Gary plan seems to provide an easy solution
for these difficulties which grow progressively
worse in the large city with every year.</p>

<p class='c007'>“2. The possibility of a better division of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>time between the old and the new studies,
the ‘regular studies’ and ‘special activities.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gary plan provides not only an enriched
curriculum, but an unusually favorable
and harmonious balance between the
various activities. The larger emphasis on
science and manual work has not made the
school ultra-utilitarian in its purpose. The
Gary schools have not been “turned into
mills and factories,” as certain educators have
feared. For many visitors, the Gary school
is a living refutation of the idea that the useful
and the beautiful are opposed. The new
school plants, such as the Emerson and Froebel,
are spacious and dignified buildings,
with many touches of thoughtful taste that
one usually associates only with the high
schools of exceptionally wealthy and cultivated
suburban communities. The presence
of pictures, the cultivation of music, the emphasis
on expression, the teaching of literature,
the systematic use of the public library,
indicate a determined effort to bring the cultural
aspects of education to the front, and
make them as real a part of the school life as
the more striking special activities. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“application” work involves constant care
and interest in the enhancement of the beauty
of the school plant. The actual charm of the
school life in Gary—the conservatories and
gardens, the play, the freedom of the children,
the dramatic expression, the absence
of strain and confusion, the happiness of the
children—is testified to by most visitors.
A very beautiful school life seems to be lived,
paradoxical as it may seem, where every
activity is motivated by application and
expression, where the learning is by doing
and not by mere studying.</p>

<p class='c007'>“3. Greater flexibility in adapting studies
to exceptional children of all kinds, thereby
diminishing the necessity of special schools.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Gary plan provides a school which is
adapted to almost every kind of a child. It
does not try to adapt the child to the school,
casting off automatically those who do not
fit. But it adapts the school to the very unequal
needs and capacities of the children.
Such a school seems to be one where capacities
will be developed wherever there are
capacities, a school where something like
equal educational opportunity can be given,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>as it cannot be in the ordinary public school.
It can almost be said that the only reason
for keeping a child home from the Gary
school would be a case of contagious disease.
If the child is physically weak, so that he
cannot undertake all the work, he may take
what he can and use the other facilities of
the school as one would use a sanitarium for
regaining health. The daily program permits
a child to spend all his time in the special activities
if this is best for him. He may spend
his time resting in the open air, or in supervised
play until he gains strength to do the
regular work. The defective child may work
at what he can in the way of manual activity.
And the retarded child may take such
activities as will awaken his interest, and
gradually bring him up to the level of his
grade. An elementary school system like this
has no need for the expensive special open-air
schools, classes for defectives, etc., special
trade schools or commercial schools. In the
organized life of the complete school community,
the child may find approximately
what he needs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“4. The possibility of more expert teaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>through the extension of the departmental
plan of organization.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“5. The better use of playtime, thereby
preventing influences which undo the work
of the schools.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“6. More realism in vocational and industrial
work, by placing it under the direction
of expert workmen from the ranks of
laboring men, selected for their personal
qualities and teaching ability as well as their
skill in the trade industries.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The organization of the industrial and
other vocational work offers many practical
advantages to the young worker. Not only
does he have the evening continuation courses
and the privilege of coming back to the school
shops in the daytime when unemployed,
but the most practical foundation is laid for
the development of coöperative courses between
school and factory on the lines of the
well-known Fitchburg plan. The flexibility
of administration and curriculum in the Gary
school allows him to attend the academic
class during slack hours, or to divide the job
and the school with another student. The
Gary school even offers to provide special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>instruction for part-time students for any
desired number of hours a week, or allows
them to work on their own initiative. In
1914 in Gary there were said to be about one
hundred part-time students. The plan of
the all-year school also offers peculiar opportunities
to the young worker. The opportunity
of finding employment is increased
fourfold. For instead of throwing all the
pupils on the market to find jobs at the same
time, one quarter of those who needed work
would be available throughout the year.
Instead of one continuous apprentice in an
industry or trade, therefore, four pupils could
take his place in alternation. Instead of one
young workman spending all his time at work
and none at school, four would be getting a
full schooling of thirty-six weeks in the year,
and twelve weeks of practical apprentice
training in the factory. Thus the Gary plan
makes it easy for the young worker to get
the maximum benefit of the modern school
and his apprenticeship at the same time.</p>

<p class='c007'>A word should be said about the value of
the vocational industrial training that the
Gary school gives, from the point of view of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>preparation for efficiency in the industrial
world. The organization of the manual work
as a part of the regular curriculum prevents
the narrow specialization of the trade school.
It tends to turn the young worker out, not as
a part of the industrial machine fitted to do
only one thing, but equipped to meet a dynamic,
rapidly changing industrial world
which demands above all things versatility,
and which scraps methods and machines as
ruthlessly as it does men. Only the man of
rounded training and resourcefulness who can
turn his hand quickly to a variety of occupations
has a chance to-day to rise above the
mass. The tendency of the old public school,
in spite of its fancied “liberal” curriculum,
was to turn out only very low-grade specialists
in book-learning. The student who comes
from the well-rounded curriculum of the Gary
school into the industrial world is bound to
be more alert, more interested in, and more
cognizant of, what he is doing. The Gary
school seems to be making an effort to produce
the type of mind perhaps the most
needed to-day, that of the versatile engineer,
the mind that adapts and masters mechanism.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>This exactness, resourcefulness, inventiveness,
pragmatic judgment of a machine
by its product, the sense of machinery as a
means not an end in itself,—these qualities
of mind which come from an emphasis on
applied science are the qualities which society
demands in almost every industry, profession,
and trade. The Gary school tends to
cultivate this type of intelligence. For this
type of mind, “culture” would not be a fringe,
but a more or less integral part of life, because
it had been woven in from the earliest years
in the school community. On the other hand,
skilled labor would not seem degrading or of
lower value, for it too would have had its
equal part in the school life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“7. Better facilities for the promotion of
the health of children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The large amount of play, the spacious
and sanitary school plants, the care of the
special school physicians and school nurses
who devote their whole time to the purpose,
insure the needed attention to the physical
well-being of the children.</p>

<p class='c007'>“8. The possibility of having pupils do
work in more than one grade and of promoting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>them by subjects instead of by
grades.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“9. The possibility of having pupils help
each other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The “helper and observer” system, applied
not only in the relations between children,
but between teachers, and between
teachers inside the school and visitors, is one
of the most valuable features of the Gary
plan. It entirely alters the usual relations,
making for a coöperative instead of a competitive
spirit in work, and facilitating enormously
the work of both pupils and teachers.
Children learn by watching and asking questions—“picking
up”—in the most natural
way in the world, in contrast to the formal
and stilted ways of the traditional classroom
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>“10. An organization which prevents a
chasm between the elementary and high
school, and prevents dropping out of school
at critical periods in the lives of pupils by
the introduction, at such times, of subjects
which appeal to awakening interests not satisfied
by a continuous and exclusive devotion
to the ‘common branches.’”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>The Gary plan, which includes all the
grades in one school plant wherever possible,
prevents these chasms more successfully
than even such schemes as the junior high
school which are being extensively experimented
with elsewhere. The Gary school has
an extraordinary hold on its pupils. There
is no incentive for leaving school, since the
school provides for the needs of the most
diversely equipped children, gives them the
practical vocational training they may want,
and even allows their working part-time while
continuing with the school. All those problems
of “pupil-mortality,” whereby half the
children in our public schools are said never
to pass beyond the sixth grade, are almost
automatically avoided in a school which deliberately
sets itself to meeting the individual
child’s needs. The success of the Gary school
in holding its pupils is indicated in the fact
that, in spite of the short time the Gary
schools have been in existence, the proportion
of high-school pupils in Gary is said to be
almost twice as large as that in the schools of
New York City.</p>

<p class='c007'>“11. A saving in the cost of instruction by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>reducing overhead charges for supervisors,
making it possible to pay better salaries or
reduce the number of pupils per teacher, or
both.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“12. A plan which brings together, in a
unitary way, with economy and efficiency in
management, the other recreational and educational
agencies of the city.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These evaluations of Dean Burris’s sum up
the various aspects of the Gary plan as it
appeals to practical educators. It must be
remembered that the Gary school represents
not a rigid system, or a static and completed
mechanism. Its chief value is that it provides
a flexible program and facility for
change and development. Any examples of
details in the curricula or details of administration
can only be tentative, for it is an
experimental school, where every one is constantly
studying and learning. It is a growing
organism. The only limit to its growth
seems to lie in the imagination of teachers
and pupils. Even when it starts with an admirable
equipment, its life is only begun. It
is the use of the equipment, the constant
appeal to the imagination and to expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>that is the real education. In such a school,
the cultivation of resource may go on indefinitely.
Such a school provides that “embryonic
community life” which Professor
Dewey expresses as his ideal of a school,
where in actual work the child senses the
occupations and interests of the larger world
into which he is some time actively to
enter.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may say, then, that the Gary school
has national significance because it is the
first public school system in successful established
operation which has been able to
solve the pressing and apparently insoluble
problems of the city school; which has kept
pace with changing industrial and social conditions,
and adapts the school to every kind
of a child; which synthesizes the best educational
endeavors of the day, and provides
the facilities which educators have vainly
sought to provide for all the children, but
have only succeeded in providing at great
expense for the more advanced and older
pupils of the community; which marks a distinct
advance in democratic education; which
realizes the ideal of a truly public school, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>providing for all the people all of the time;
and, which, in its simple organization and
ingenious financial economies, furnishes a
practical working-model for imitation and
adaptation in other communities, large and
small.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>These</span> twelve schools, I am informed, are the
most congested of any group of twelve schools in
New York City. There are only 25,331 sittings
in these schools and 35,580 children were registered
December 31, 1914,—10,249 more than
sittings. The registration is 140 per cent of the
sittings. But 2500 of the present sittings, representing
50 classrooms, are unsatisfactory. There
are 779 classes in the schools and only 480 satisfactory
classrooms. The classes are 162 per cent of
the satisfactory classrooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two new schools are under construction, and a
leased school-building of fifteen classrooms is
nearing completion. These three buildings will
provide accommodations for 4500 children and
103 additional classes. When these three buildings
are completed, there will be 583 satisfactory classrooms
for 779 classes. The registration of the
twelve schools increased 4000 pupils from December
31, 1913, to December 31, 1914. At the present
rate of increase the new buildings will not take
care of the increase in school attendance during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the construction of the said buildings. Four new
buildings in addition to those under construction
are needed now to give each child attending the
schools a satisfactory school seat. Because of financial
limitations the Board of Education is
asking for only six new elementary-school buildings
for the entire city, and <i>two</i> of the six, <i>to cost
approximately $1,000,000</i>, are proposed for the
relief of the twelve schools named. If the two
additional schools requested, together with the
three under construction, could be made ready
for use to-morrow, there would still be 4000 children
without satisfactory seats and no provision
for normal growth in the immediate future.</p>

<p class='c007'>I herewith submit a plan for the reorganization
of the twelve schools named, so that 1022
classes may be satisfactorily accommodated in
place of the 583 now provided for.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the New Organization unsatisfactory
annexes are vacated, and unsatisfactory classrooms
are used for auditorium, playrooms, laboratories,
and workshops. In place of the 779 classes
and 35,580 children now in the schools, room will
be secured for 242 additional classes and a total
registration of 46,000 children. A future increase
in school registration of approximately 10,000
children will thus be provided for.</p>

<p class='c007'>To accomplish this reorganization, rather extensive
annexes are necessary at four schools,
costing approximately $475,000. The remaining
eight schools need only slight structural changes
and additional equipment, costing approximately
$44,500. Additional land should be purchased
for four of the schools, costing approximately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>$225,000 [a total of $744,500 for twelve schools, as
against $1,000,000 for two new plants on the old
plan].</p>

<p class='c007'>The cost of the four annexes, the remodeling,
the equipment, and the additional land will be
much less than the cost for buildings, equipment,
and sites for the proposed two new schools. If
the proposed two-new-schools plan is followed, a
total satisfactory capacity on a five-hour single-school
system for 671 classes will be secured,
which is 108 classes short of the present enrollment.
If the reorganization at less cost than the
two-new-schools plan is followed, satisfactory
accommodations in a longer school day will be
secured for 1022 classes, which is 243 classes more
than are now enrolled,—a difference of 351
classes and 16,000 children.</p>

<p class='c007'>The true economy of the New Organization is
to be found in the greater educational facilities
provided for all of the children, rather than in
the great capacity of the plants secured under the
new plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>The upper grades, 511 classes, will have a daily
school program of the following type: 80 minutes
in classroom for academic work; 40 minutes in
gymnasium or play-yard or grounds for physical
training and play; 40 minutes for general exercises
in the auditorium; 60 minutes for luncheon;
140 minutes in classroom for academic work;
and 80 minutes for drawing-rooms, science laboratories,
or manual-training and workshops.
The lower grades, 511 classes, will have a program
of the following type: same as for upper grades,
except that the last period of 80 minutes will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>given to play, excursions, library, church instruction,
or at home. As a rule the children will have
380 minutes in school in addition to the luncheon
hour, in place of the 300 minutes provided in the
regular full-time school. Such a study-work-and-play
school removes the children very largely
from the demoralizing life of the street, and gives
ample time for academic, physical, and prevocational
training.</p>

    <div><i>Indicating in Detail Necessary Changes to introduce Wirt Plan</i></div>

<p class='c032'><i>Public School 28</i> has fifty-eight regular classes
in forty-five regular classrooms, with one wood-working
shop and one cooking-room. The ground
floor play-yard and fine basement playroom provide
ample play space for nine classes at one time.
There is a large gymnasium on the top floor that
is not desirable for play, and should be used for
drawing-rooms. The auditorium on the fourth
floor should be made into six regular classrooms
by installing permanent partitions for the sliding
partitions. The wall partitions should be removed
from the four combination auditorium and classrooms
on the second floor, and the auditorium
thus secured should be seated for a permanent
auditorium. Since four classrooms are thus used
for the auditorium, there will be left only forty-one
regular classrooms. Thirty-six of these should
be used for regular class work. Two of the five
remaining classrooms should be used for science
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>laboratories, one for a music studio, and two for
workshops. These five special rooms, with the
manual-training shop and cooking-room and
drawing-studios, will provide facilities for nine
classes in science, drawing, music, manual-training
or shopwork, at one time. Seventy-two regular
classes may be accommodated in this school
with thirty-six classes in thirty-six classrooms,
nine in the auditorium, nine at play, nine in
special work, and nine primary classes with an
extra period for play, religious instruction in
churches, excursions, library work, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a full register of classes, seventy-six teachers
should be employed. Fifty-six teachers should
teach the history, geography, arithmetic, language,
and reading, and manage the auditorium.
Two teachers should have charge of the music,
four of the play and physical training, one of the
library, two of the drawing, two of the science
laboratories, and nine of the manual training,
domestic science and art, and the shopwork.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are thirteen regular classes in the eight-room
frame annex, which must be used for class
purposes in order to enable the city to hold the
property. A special program can be arranged for
this annex, to accommodate twelve classes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Public School 28 and the annex can therefore
accommodate eighty-four classes, a gain of thirteen
classes over the present enrollment, and
thirty-one classes more than the normal capacity
of fifty-three classes in a single-school system.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only expense will be the placing of permanent
partitions in the auditorium classrooms, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>the equipment of the auditorium, laboratories,
studios and shops,—approximately $10,000.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c007'><i>Public School 5</i> has twenty-seven classes in
nineteen regular classrooms, a good auditorium
and two portable schools. Four classes are now
using the auditorium as classrooms, with only
curtains for partitions. There is play space in the
basement play-yard for six classes to play at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>By removing the portable schools a satisfactory
outdoor playground can be secured. The
basement has a fine shoproom, large enough to
accommodate two small shops. In these shops and
the nineteen classrooms, with the auditorium and
play facilities, thirty-two classes may be accommodated
by using sixteen of the most desirable
rooms for classrooms. This is five classes more
than are now in the school, and thirteen more than
the capacity of the main building on a five-hour
single-school system.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cost of moving the portables should be
charged to the school to which they are moved.
The cost for equipment and remodeling should be
approximately $5,000.</p>

<hr class='c021' />

<p class='c007'><i>Public School 32</i> has sixty classes in thirty-eight
classrooms, with one workshop and one cooking-room.
Five classrooms and one cooking-room are
now in a gymnasium with only curtains for partitions.
Three classrooms are unsatisfactory basement
rooms, one is an unsatisfactory attic room,
and twelve classrooms are combination auditorium
and classrooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>By placing permanent partitions in the combination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>auditoriums, twenty-nine satisfactory classrooms
and five shoprooms may be secured. The
gymnasium and play-yard are ample for a large
school. The building is close to Bronx Park for
large outdoor play-yard and for gardens. The
present site can be enlarged without great cost.
I believe that it is desirable to make Public School
32 a seventy-two-room school, which will enable
it to accommodate twelve more classes than are
now in the school.</p>

<p class='c007'>An annex should be built containing swimming-pool,
auditorium, five shops, and seven classrooms,
costing approximately $100,000.</p>

    <div class='c000'><span class='c038'><i>Showing the Adaptation of the Gary Plan to the Usual School Plant</i></span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>This</span> school was the first to be reorganized in New
York City under the Gary plan. The following quotations
from Superintendent Wirt’s report indicate the
changes that were made in transforming a congested
elementary school into a smoothly running Gary school
on the duplicate plan:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Prior to November 6, 1914, there were forty
classes attending School 89. Twelve of the forty
classes, representing the upper grades, were on full
time, having the exclusive use of twelve of the
twenty-six classrooms. The remaining twenty-eight
classes were organized in groups of fourteen
classes each and were accommodated in the remaining
fourteen classrooms, small auditorium,
and five cellar rooms, with a modification of the
accompanying program. (See p. <a href='#Page_191'>191</a>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Since in this program twelve classrooms were
used exclusively for twelve classes, the burden of
the overcrowding was placed entirely upon the
remaining fourteen classrooms. These fourteen
rooms had a multiple use for eight hours a day, but
the auditorium and playground were used only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>two hours a day. This means that the auditorium
and playground were congested during the short
time that they were in use. When it rained and all
the children were required to be in the building
from 9.30 to 11.30, nine classes were forced to use
the five cellar rooms at one time as study-rooms.
No provision was made for the systematic use of
other child-welfare agencies.</p>

single-system school offers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principle underlying the old program was
that of securing the traditional five-hour school
day by supplementing the four hours in the classroom
with an additional hour in playground and
auditorium. Unfortunately the latter hour was
used as much as possible for study in quarters that
were never intended for use as a study-room and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>cannot be made satisfactory for study. No one
offers the argument that such a five-hour school is
better than or even as good as five hours of regular
classroom work in the ordinary single-system
school.</p>

<p class='c007'>This program was not intended to secure greater
facilities for children than the ordinary single-system
school offers. The purpose was to secure
as nearly as possible the traditional work of the
regular five-hour full-time school, and it was considered
only as a temporary expedient until a
sufficient number of new schools could be built to
provide the regulation full-time school. Since the
main object was the building of additional school-buildings
for permanent relief, no funds could be
expended upon this temporary double-system
expedient.</p>

<p class='c007'>In contrast to this, the new program at Public
School 89 is in no sense an effort to relieve part-time
by giving the children as nearly as possible
a five-hour traditional school day until a new
building can be built.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sole purpose determining the new program
now in use at this school is that of securing a six-hour
day and much richer opportunities in a study-work-and-play
school with a coördination of the
activities of all child-welfare agencies.</p>

<p class='c007'>By making the following improvements at
Public School 89, the increase in capacity and
additional facilities can be made permanent—a
gymnasium and swimming-pool, two rooms for
branch of the public library, equipment for science
laboratories and auditorium, wardrobes for sixteen
classes, permanent playground, and drawing and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>music studios. With the exception of the playground,
the above will cost approximately $35,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cost of the site and the proposed new fifty-one
unit school-building, to relieve Public School
89 and two other buildings, will provide the funds
for similar changes in ten schools after the plan at
Public School 89. These changes would make possible
a permanent increase in capacity of not less
than two hundred classrooms, since in the more
modern schools a less expenditure will secure
greater capacity. Since a fifty-one unit building
adds accommodation for only forty-eight traditional
full-time classes, the satisfactory accommodation
of sixteen additional classes at Public
School 89 would justify the expenditure of one
third the cost of the new building and site upon
Public School 89, or approximately $170,000.
But, as has just been pointed out, it is not necessary
to spend anything like this amount.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the old program there were only forty
classes, but one class was very large and was
divided into two sections with two teachers in
charge. The number of pupils attending this
school is increasing rapidly, and therefore a program
for forty-two classes is planned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The forty-two classes in the New Program are
divided into two duplicate schools of twenty-one
classes each. In the following programs these
duplicate schools are designated as the “X”
School and the “Y” School.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The X School</i>: Twenty-one of the classrooms are
used for the desired academic instruction in the
regular school subjects,—arithmetic, language,
reading, history, and geography. The five remaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>classrooms are used for the special school subjects,—science,
drawing, and music. In addition
to the twenty-six classrooms, the school has a
manual-training shop, a domestic-science laboratory,
a small auditorium, five cellar playrooms,
and a kindergarten. Because the special rooms
are not yet equipped (January 9, 1915), for the
time being they are used for additional regular
class work. Since there is no library or librarian,
and since the manual-training and cooking teachers
are at the building only half-time, two extra
special teachers are in charge of the playground.</p>

<p class='c007'>The X School has the following activities and
facilities for carrying them on:—</p>

</table>
<p class='c032'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>The actual time spent by the teachers according
to the New Program is no longer than the established
time. Each teacher has 210 minutes in
regular activities, and 100 in special activities,
with 20 minutes for assembling of pupils, a total of
330 minutes, which is the established time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The two periods in special activities should be
departmentalized by certain teachers giving both
periods to play and physical training, and other
teachers giving both periods to music, drawing,
and science, etc. The manual-training teachers
and the public librarian release two teachers from
the work periods, who may be assigned to play
and physical training. Six teachers should run the
auditorium period, and the remaining teacher of
the Division should be assigned to play and physical
training. The only extra teachers are the
manual-training teachers. If there are a few teachers
who cannot do the work of the special activities
successfully, they may give all of this time to regular
school activities. The teachers so displaced
from regular activities may give all of their time
to physical training and play, music, drawing, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>About half of the teachers will have an extra
50-minute period in the school for grading papers,
planning school work, looking after individual
needs of children, or professional study. In my
judgment it would be well if all teachers did their
supplementary school work at the school rather
than at home. Less energy will be required to do
this work at the school than at home, and the
public will have a better understanding of the
teacher’s work.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span><i>The Y School</i>: Unfortunately the program described
requires twenty-six classrooms for twenty-one
classes of children in addition to the auditorium,
play space, library, workshops, etc. No
facility during the school day is used more than
half the time by the X School. Fortunately the
auditorium need be large enough to accommodate
only one third of the X School. The same is true
of the play space and the special work facilities.
There is a great economy in using the facilities
named for three periods by alternate groups, each
representing one third of the school. But a higher
first cost and a greater operation and maintenance
cost would be justifiable in all these facilities, including
the regular classrooms, if they could be
used longer and accommodate more children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since the X School can use any of these facilities
only half of the time, what objection can there be
to another school of twenty-one classes using the
facilities when the X School cannot use them?
On p. 198 is shown a program for such a duplicate
school, designated Y.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Y School has the same time as the X School,
for both pupils and teachers. Neither school could
use any facility any more if the other school were
not there, but both schools have better facilities
every hour of the day because the other school is
there. Forty-two classes of children are thus accommodated
in twenty-six classrooms. Instead of
building a sixteen-room additional school, with
its initial cost of construction, site, janitor service,
heating, maintenance, etc., an equivalent expenditure
can be made for the permanent improvement
and increased operating cost of the twenty-six-room
school.</p>

<p class='c010'>While this program makes two schools in one
possible, primarily it is planned to provide a longer
school day, i.e., six hours in place of five, and
greater facilities for each child during each of the
six hours. One hundred minutes’ daily play is
given to the primary grades, for play takes the
place of work for small children. This play is
gradually transformed into work, fifty minutes’
work and fifty minutes’ play in the intermediate
grades, and one hundred minutes’ work in the
grammar grades, as the older children use their
after-school leisure time for play. Thus the play
impulse is transformed into the work impulse.
Productive activities are substituted for non-productive
activities. Work is made constructive
play.</p>

</div>
<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Superintendent Wirt</span>, at the meeting of the
Department of Superintendence of the National
Education Association, St. Louis, February,
1912 spoke as follows:—</p>

<p class='c007'>We have not utilized the school plants completely
unless they are used for recreation and
social centers by adults. Fortunately, a school
plant that provides for the constructive play and
recreation activities of children is also most admirably
adapted for similar activities with adults.
The playground, gymnasiums, swimming-pools,
auditorium, club and social rooms, library, shops,
laboratories, etc., make a complete social and recreation
center for adults. Experience has demonstrated
that the facilities for academic instruction
add also to the attractiveness of the plant as
a social and recreation center.</p>

<p class='c007'>Compared with the cost of such facilities and
their use when separated from the school plant,
the economy of the combined playground, workshop,
and school plant is indeed surprising. The
city of Chicago has a most elaborate system of
recreation parks and field-houses. Selecting the
eleven most successful parks of the South Park
Commission, we may compare the total cost and
use of the eleven parks with the cost and use of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>one Gary school plant. Note that the attendance
of the parks is the total, not the average, for the
eleven parks. Also note that the cost of the school
includes the furnishing of complete school facilities
for twenty-seven hundred children, in addition
to the social and recreation features.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
